# AGENTS.md — development rules for Practice Compass

This file is the contract for anyone (human or AI) extending this app. Read it before
adding features. The whole value of the tool comes from what it *refuses* to do.

## The one rule above all

Preserve the core loop: **one item · one mode · one focus · one result · one next action.**
If a change blurs that loop or adds a second thing to think about per step, it's wrong —
even if it's "useful".

## Keep admin overhead low

- Starting a block must stay **under 30 seconds**; closing one **under 60 seconds**.
  Any new field in those flows must be optional and have a smart default.
- Never add a required field beyond an item title.
- Rich metadata stays progressive: hidden until the user asks for it.

## Prioritise the quick‑start flow

- Smart defaults are a feature, not a convenience. Status → mode, item → focus,
  10‑minute duration. If you add a concept, give it a sensible default too.
- Inline item creation must keep working from the Start screen and from recommendations.

## Today is a session workspace, scoped to one instrument

The user practises one instrument at a time ("I'm practising Setar now"). Today is
driven by a persisted `sessionInstrumentId`: the switcher at the top picks the
instrument, everything below it (recommendation, class work, reviews, pathway position,
quick add, Start) is scoped to that instrument, and the primary recommendation must stay
above the fold on a 390×844 phone. The cross‑instrument "Overview" is a deliberate,
secondary choice — never the default. Never hard‑code a morning/evening schedule and
never surface another instrument's work inside a session.

## Review actions have honest, distinct semantics

Practising (closing a block) is the ONLY thing that completes a review and advances
SM‑2. "Not now" hides a due review for the rest of today (no schedule change). Snooze
(+2d) genuinely moves the due date on both the review and the item — never fabricate a
result, and never leave a stale overdue item after an action. The Finish button freezes
the clock (`pauseSession`) before the close screen; reflection time is not counted.

## Hard "do nots" (require explicit user instruction to change)

- ❌ **No gamification** — no streaks, points, badges, XP, leaderboards, confetti,
  or fake "mastery %". Progress is shown as honest status + result, nothing else.
- ❌ **No backend / auth / cloud sync.** The app is local‑first: **IndexedDB (Dexie) is
  the source of truth** on the device (app state in the `kv` table, attachment blobs in
  the `attachments` table). It moves between devices only via the full backup file (JSON
  data + base64 files) — export/import. Serving the built PWA privately from the NAS
  (Web Station over Tailscale, like hess) is fine; that is static hosting, not an app
  server or sync.
- ❌ **No AI or audio analysis** in v1 — no tone scoring, pitch detection, posture
  tracking, or "AI teacher" judgement. The app organises; it does not grade.
- ❌ **No guilt‑driven copy.** Insights are neutral observations, never nags.

## The Pathway is a trust anchor — keep it that way

Pathways exist so the user can **stop deciding what's next and just practise**, at their
own pace, on a route they trust. Protect that:

- **The item is the only unit of work — pathways are a view over items.** There is no
  separate "step" object. A `PracticeItem` may carry a `stageId` (placing it inside a
  pathway stage), a `strand`, and a `catalogKey`. Stage progress is *derived* from the
  mastery status of the items in it (`itemStageState` in `pathways.ts`). Never reintroduce
  a parallel to-do list next to items.
- **The catalog is reference data in code, not persisted.** `pathwaySeed.ts` defines
  per-stage `CatalogEntry` suggestions (gushes, lesson areas) with `about` guidance for
  conscious practice; `addFromCatalog` turns one into a real item with one tap. The new
  item is honestly **"Not practised yet"** (status `new`, zero stats) with an immediate
  Undo — adding is organisation, not progress. Label suggestions as reference aids, never
  canonical. Improving the catalog needs no migration; keep entry keys stable per stage.
- **Structure, not gamification.** Show honest position (items solid / in progress /
  suggestions remaining). No streaks, scores, or fabricated mastery %.
- **Pathways/stages stay editable data** (`pathways`, `pathwayStages`, `pathwayRoutines`)
  with full CRUD. Sections are the stages' `group` string (rename via `renameSection`;
  new stages pick their section explicitly). Deleting a stage/pathway must never delete
  items — only detach them, and clear any stale `currentStageId` pin.
- **The current stage is the user's choice.** Teacher-led work jumps around:
  `Pathway.currentStageId` (pin) always wins; "first incomplete stage" is only the
  fallback. Never treat linear order as truth for Setar/Tar.
- **Pieces can have parts** (`parentItemId`): parts are ordinary items grouped under a
  piece/étude, with a deterministic "practise this part now" pick (`pickNextPart`) and a
  calm stall hint (`stallHint`) — smaller unit or new strategy, never quotas.
- **Seeds are honest starting points, never fabricated authority.** Guitar = CGS. Setar =
  a radif/dastgāh map (teacher-driven, explicitly "reorder me"). Tar = the Honarestān
  method. Dastgāh intros use standard characterisations; per-gushe `about` text stays a
  generic conscious-practice prompt (shāhed / ist / forud) — the teacher's account is the
  authority, never invent specifics as if canonical.
- **Calm, self-paced copy.** "Move on when it feels right, not by a deadline" is the voice.

## Lessons (classes) and the deadline exception

`Lesson` records (per instrument, date + free-form notes) support the user's real
workflow: record the class, rewatch it, type up notes (often **in Farsi** — all free-text
fields must stay direction-aware; `unicode-bidi: plaintext` handles this globally), then
create/link the concrete practice items (`lesson.itemIds` — a link, never ownership;
unlinking keeps the item). "Originated in this lesson" (`itemIds`) is separate from
"work on before the next class" (`assignedForLesson`), which gives a per-instrument
priority boost that climbs as that instrument's next lesson approaches
(`lessonUrgencyScore`). This is the one sanctioned "deadline" in the app — a monthly
class is a real commitment, not a manufactured streak. Keep it per-instrument and
generic (future Tar/Guitar teachers), never guilt-toned. Attachments belong to an item
OR a lesson (`AttachmentMeta.ownerType/ownerId`; blobs keyed by `ownerId` in Dexie) —
class videos stay in the user's session folders, not in the app.

## Review scheduling stays explainable

`computeReview` (in `scheduling.ts`) is an **SM-2 spaced-repetition engine** adapted to
music: per item it tracks `srReps` / `srEase` / `srIntervalDays`; good reviews expand the
interval, a slip resets it, and importance/difficulty pull material a little sooner. It
supports per-item overrides (Auto / fixed cadence / Manual) and returns a plain `rationale`.
Keep it deterministic and explainable — don't turn it into an opaque model, and keep the
SM-2 tests green. Item status labels are plain-language for the user — keep the enum keys
stable and only change the display labels in `labels.ts`.

## Device & infrastructure

This app is **iPhone-first**, installed as a PWA and served privately from the Synology NAS
(Web Station over Tailscale) via `npm run deploy` — the same pattern as **hess**, chosen
because the data + attachments are personal (never public GitHub Pages). CI (`.github/
workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint + tests + build on push; deployment stays a local one-liner.
The prod base path is `/practice-compass/` (override with `PC_BASE`).

**Devices don't sync, and the UI must never imply they do.** Each browser/device has its
own IndexedDB; moving data is an explicit backup export → import (Settings → Device &
handoff: per-device name in localStorage, export stamped with `deviceName`/`lastModified`,
and a warning before importing a backup older than local data). Navigation returns to the
explicit origin via router state (`state.from` with a safe fallback), the primary nav
renders before the page content in the DOM (bottom-fixed on phones, top on wide screens),
and the manifest has no orientation lock.

## Architecture rules

- **Domain logic stays pure.** Everything in `src/domain/` must be free of React and
  side effects, and must take an explicit `now: Date` instead of calling `new Date()`
  internally. This keeps it deterministic and unit‑testable.
- **The recommendation engine stays deterministic and explainable.** Every recommended
  card must produce a one‑sentence reason from the same numbers that ranked it. No
  hidden heuristics, no models.
- **The store is the only place that mutates app data.** UI components call store actions;
  they never touch IndexedDB or rebuild domain objects by hand. Attachment **blobs** are the
  one exception: they live in IndexedDB via `src/store/idb.ts` and the `attachments.ts`
  service (too big for the reactive JSON); only their lightweight metadata sits in the store.
- **Storage is async.** The store hydrates from IndexedDB after load; `App` gates render on
  `hydrated`. Persistence changes must keep the `migrate` + `merge` paths working and bump
  `SCHEMA_VERSION`.
- **One file per route** under `src/pages/`. Shared UI primitives live in
  `src/components/`. Pure helpers go in their own non‑component modules (this also keeps
  React Fast Refresh and the `react-refresh` lint rule happy).

## When you add a feature

1. Add/extend the **types** in `src/domain/types.ts` and bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` if the
   persisted shape changes (add a migration in the store's `persist` config).
2. Put the logic in a **pure domain module** with **tests** (`*.test.ts`). The required
   coverage — priority scoring, recommendation selection, review scheduling, stat
   updates, saturation — must stay green.
3. Only then wire up the UI.
4. Run `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` and fix everything before finishing.

## Tests are not optional

`npm test` must pass. The suite guards the behaviour that makes the recommendations
trustworthy; if you change the scoring formula or scheduling intervals, update the tests
in the same change and make sure they still describe correct behaviour.

## Roadmap items are allowed (they were designed for)

Audio recording attachment, PWA offline install, CSV export, calendar reminders, a
simple audio note per block, teacher‑sharing PDF. These extend the tool without breaking
the philosophy. Anything that contradicts the "do nots" above needs an explicit decision
from the user, recorded here.
