# CLAUDE.md — development rules for Practice Compass

This file is the contract for anyone (human or AI) extending this app. Read it before
adding features. The whole value of the tool comes from what it *refuses* to do.

## The one rule above all

Preserve the core loop: **one item · one mode · one focus · one result · one next action.**
If a change blurs that loop or adds a second thing to think about per step, it's wrong —
even if it's "useful".

**The loop CLOSES: the next action is read, not just written.** `PracticeBlock.nextAction`
was captured on every close and read nowhere, so the one thing deliberately decided last
time never reached the moment it was written for. `ActiveBlock` now shows it at the top,
before you start playing, via `lastNextAction` (`blocks.ts`, tested) — the most recent
NON-EMPTY one, so a later block that recorded none does not blank out a decision that
still stands. Anything the app asks you to record, it must eventually USE.

## Keep admin overhead low

- Starting a block must stay **under 30 seconds**; closing one **under 60 seconds**.
  Any new field in those flows must be optional and have a smart default.
- Never add a required field beyond an item title.
- Rich metadata stays progressive: hidden until the user asks for it.

## Prioritise the quick‑start flow

- Smart defaults are a feature, not a convenience. Status → mode, item → focus,
  10‑minute duration. If you add a concept, give it a sensible default too.
- Inline item creation must keep working from the Start screen and from recommendations.
- **Exactly two creation paths, both one-step.** Quick add = title only (Start's
  inline create is also title-only, with a link to the full form that returns to Start
  with the item preselected). The full form ("Add practice item", `/items/new`, also
  inline edit) is KIND-FIRST: it asks what you're adding (gusheh / composed piece /
  piece / étude / passage / technique — `src/components/itemKinds.ts`, tested) and
  shows only that kind's identity fields, in three groups: "What are you adding? /
  Connect it (optional) / First practice setup". Connections (study source with inline
  create, pathway stage, lesson, parent work) are settable AT creation — no
  create-then-edit round trips, and never a third half-detailed path. Item detail
  shows a "Connected to" summary near the top.

## Today is a session workspace, scoped to one instrument

The user practises one instrument at a time ("I'm practising Setar now"). Today is
driven by a persisted `sessionInstrumentId`: the switcher at the top picks the
instrument, everything below it (recommendation, class work, reviews, pathway position,
quick add, Start) is scoped to that instrument, and the primary recommendation must stay
above the fold on a 390×844 phone. The cross‑instrument "Overview" is a deliberate,
secondary choice — never the default. Never hard‑code a morning/evening schedule and
never surface another instrument's work inside a session. The Session Plan and
Routines are two independent, peer doorway cards (`PlanCard`/`RoutinesCard` in
`Today.tsx`) — a time-budgeted session and following a routine are separate systems,
and OWNER acceptance testing (2026‑08‑28) found nesting routines inside the Session
Plan's expanded panel read as routines being subordinate to picking a duration, so
they were pulled out into their own doorway. Both start collapsed (~50px) so the
primary recommendation stays above the fold; each has its own open/close state and
its own "Resume your plan"/"Resume your routine" takeover. Routines are scoped to the
session instrument (`routinesForInstrument`), each row showing Edit and — when a
segment is essential — a visible "Short on time — essentials only" button, plus "New
routine" ("Create a routine" when there are none yet). Today is the ONLY surface an
unplaced routine is reachable from at all, so its rows carry the same Edit/Start/
short-on-time affordances StageDetail's `RoutineCard`/PathwayDetail's `RoutineRow`
give a placed one.

## Review actions have honest, distinct semantics

Practising (closing a block) is the ONLY thing that completes a review and advances
SM‑2. "Not now" hides a due review for the rest of today (no schedule change). Snooze
(+2d) genuinely moves the due date on both the review and the item — never fabricate a
result, and never leave a stale overdue item after an action. The Finish button freezes
the clock (`pauseSession`) before the close screen; reflection time is not counted.

**ANSWERING NOTHING IS NOT DECLINING.** A result is REQUIRED to save a block — the six
options are already the first thing on the close screen, so this adds no field (r-quick-start
holds: it makes a choice already present a required one), and "Save without a result" keeps
`not_logged` reachable and DELIBERATE. `computeReviewOutcome` takes a tri-state
`ReviewAnswer` (`'scheduled' | 'declined' | 'unanswered'`) and returns
`completeOpenReviews` ALONGSIDE `nextReviewDate`, because they are ONE decision: a close
carrying no result keeps the item's date AND leaves its open Review row OPEN, while a
genuine decline still clears the date and completes the row. `closeSession` must never
decide the row separately — completing every open row unconditionally, next to a
`!scheduleReview` branch that cleared the date, is exactly how one skipped tap used to
erase the next date, close the open review, leave SM‑2 state stale and drop the item out
of Due reviews for good, all while the panel read "Should this come back? Yes" above an
empty date field. The row transform is `completeOpenReviewsFor` (`scheduling.ts`, tested)
so the array change is reachable from a Node test; `CloseBlock` states the mapping in one
place and the escape hatch forces `'unanswered'` even when a result had already filled in
a date. r-explainable-scheduling's "the date shown is the date saved" now includes when
that date is deliberately left UNCHANGED.

## Nothing replaces an unfinished practice session

`src/domain/practiceSession.ts` (pure, tested) is the sibling of `practiceSignal.ts`: that
module owns pure decisions about a running clock's SIGNALS, this one owns pure decisions
about the unfinished SESSION. Two INDEPENDENT questions live there and must never be
conflated:

- **PRESENCE** (`hasUnfinishedPractice`, `decideReplacement`) — does an unfinished session
  exist? That, and ONLY that, decides whether a whole-database replacement may proceed.
  Never `running`, so PAUSING PROTECTS A SESSION RATHER THAN EXPOSING IT; the frozen
  `active`+`activeRoutine` pair the persist `merge` produces is unfinished practice like
  any other.
- **PLAUSIBILITY** (`isStaleClock`, `proposedCloseMinutes`) — does this session's elapsed
  figure still look like time someone played? That decides the minutes `CloseBlock`
  proposes and the ATTENTION state, and NOTHING else.

**A HEURISTIC ABOUT A DURATION NEVER BECOMES AN AUTHORITY TO DESTROY PRACTICE.** A stale
verdict must never be wired to a destructive path, and `decideReplacement` must keep
reaching the SAME decision for a stale session as for a live one (a session paused at
three genuine hours crosses any sensible threshold — discarding it would lose real
practice). Staleness may never be fed into `shouldKeepAwake` or `nextSignal` either.

`active` lives outside `db`, so `withRevision` never bumps `rev` while you practise: a
mid-block device looks UNCHANGED to `decideSync`, a remote change resolves to `pull`, and
the in-flight block is destroyed with no archive and no prompt. So: AUTOMATIC sync
(`syncNow`) checks the predicate BEFORE attempting and reports a distinct `deferred`
SyncPhase — a background merge waiting its turn is not an error and must not be dressed as
one — while DELIBERATE replacement (Import, Restore archive, Keep remote) gets an explicit
refusal naming the session. The guard for the inbound paths is the FIRST statement of
`importFullBackup` (`backup.ts`), before the JSON is even parsed: `replaceAllBlobs` below
it destroys every attachment blob, so a check placed after it would wipe them while
returning "nothing was changed". Every deliberate caller already surfaces
`{ok:false,error}`, so no `Settings.tsx` change is needed.

The inbound guard is checked TWICE, and the second one is what makes it hold: the first
check is `importFullBackup`'s opening statement, but `await replaceAllBlobs(...)` below it
yields to the event loop, so a tap that starts a block while that transaction is in flight
would reach `importDB` — which nulls `active`/`activeRoutine` — with no guard between. The
second check sits in the same synchronous tick as the install, with nothing awaited in
between, so it is genuinely the last word. It refuses honestly: the blobs are already
written by then, so the message says so and invites re-running the import rather than
claiming nothing changed. Both checks take the CALLER'S INTENT (`importFullBackup(text,
intent)`), because a sync pull that reaches them is still AUTOMATIC — `syncNow` checked
before the network fetch, and practice can begin during it. It defers, and `githubSync.ts`
carries that verdict back out to `applyOutcome` (`pendingDeferral`, module scope for the
same reason `running` is) so the phase is `deferred`, never `error`: App.tsx's retry
watches `deferred`, so an `error` here would stop sync until something else happened to
trigger one — the silent outage this lane exists to prevent. Ordering is NOT reversed to fix
this — `replaceAllBlobs` is one
IndexedDB transaction, so a failed blob write rolls back and leaves blobs and `db` alike
untouched, which installing the `db` first would give up.

PRESENCE IS NOT THE WHOLE GUARD. `decideReplacement` has TWO blocking reasons, and both
are about practice that would be DESTROYED — neither is a heuristic about a duration. The
second is the local REVISION: an inbound snapshot may only be installed over the database
it was compared with. A block started AND FINISHED while a pull is in flight leaves no
unfinished session for presence to see. That block is not in the incoming snapshot, and —
if it landed after the pre-sync archive was taken — not in the only other copy either, so
installing the snapshot would destroy a minute that was genuinely played. So `importFullBackup(text, intent,
decidedFromRev)` compares the `rev` the replacement was DECIDED against with the `rev` now,
in the same call as the presence check (ONE call answering both, so no await can ever be
slipped between them). `rev` is a monotonic counter bumped on every db mutation, never a
clock — no timestamp enters a sync decision. It only moves on a user action: `useSyncStatus`
is a separate store and no effect or timer writes `db`, so a quiet sync run never trips it.
The baseline is anchored where the decision was actually made — `buildLocalSnapshot` in
`githubSync.ts` records it (`syncBaselineRev`, module scope for the same reason `running`
is) so the guarded window covers the remote fetch and the archive too, not just
`replaceAllBlobs`. It does NOT read that number from the store itself: it takes the one
`buildFullBackupWithRev` (`backup.ts`) returns, captured in the SAME statement as the
database (`const { db, rev } = useStore.getState()`) and before `allBlobs()` yields. Read
after that await, the baseline would pair an OLD copy of the data with a NEWER revision
number, and a block finished while the attachment blobs were being read would make
`decideReplacement` — which is itself correct — answer "nothing was written since" about a
database that had been written to. The pure decision is tested; this WIRING is protected
structurally, the same way `installDatabase`'s is: the revision is not reachable from
anywhere but the statement that reads the database. It is passed IN, never read from module scope inside `importFullBackup`:
a manual Import or an archive restore has no earlier decision point than its own call and
defaults to the `rev` on entry, and a stale baseline would make it refuse for no reason.
PRESENCE is answered first so a message that can name the blocking session still does
(ac-8). This deferral needs no retry watcher of its own — there is no blocking session for
the presence retry to watch clear, but the very write that raised it bumped `rev`, which
App.tsx's quiet-period auto-sync already watches, and the next run sees both sides changed
and offers the owner an explicit conflict with both copies preserved. That trigger is only
reliable because A SYNC REQUEST ARRIVING WHILE ONE RUNS IS REMEMBERED, NEVER DROPPED
(`rerunWanted` in `githubSync.ts`: `syncNow` sets it instead of returning into nothing, and
the run loops once more when it is set). `running` used to make such a request a silent
no-op, so a run outlasting the 30-second quiet period swallowed the single retry that
revision had scheduled and then deferred for that very revision — permanently waiting on a
condition nothing was watching. Remembering the request fixes that at the root, for every
trigger (open, quiet period, back online, deferral cleared) rather than for one
counterexample, and cannot spin: the flag is cleared at the top of each lap, so another lap
needs a genuinely new request that arrived during the previous one. `resolveConflict` drains
it too — a request that arrived while the owner was deciding is owed a run just the same.

A stale clock is labelled wherever the block appears on Today — the In-progress card AND
the "still running elsewhere" row (`StaleNote`) — because those two are exhaustive and
labelling only the first left the same block silent after switching instrument or choosing
Overview, where with no GitHub sync configured no deferral notice exists either. A stale
ROUTINE carries no such note: a run has no single target to judge an elapsed figure
against, and `segmentElapsed` already clamps each segment to its authored duration.

The deferral is VISIBLE and BOUNDED, never a silent permanent outage: `SyncNotice`
(`Layout.tsx`) renders `deferred` and says what it is waiting on, Today labels a stale
clock wherever the block is shown, and the resolution is the owner's — Finish, correct the minutes, or
Discard. The RETRY watches the BLOCKING CONDITION CLEARING (`deferredSyncRetry`, an effect
in `App.tsx` keyed on presence), never `rev`: `closeSession` writes a block and bumps the
counter but `cancelSession` is a bare `set({ active: null })` that writes nothing, so a
rev-watching retry resumes after a finish and waits forever after a discard. Seed the
previous-presence ref with the CURRENT presence, or an ordinary load reads as a
present→absent transition and fires a spurious sync.

**Installing a database clears the ephemeral state that pointed at the old one.**
`installDatabase` returns the new `db` TOGETHER WITH `active`/`activeRoutine`/`activePlan`
nulled, `notNow` reset and a `sessionInstrumentId` that survives only if it still resolves
(`'all'` always survives). Its SIGNATURE is the guarantee: `importDB`, `resetDemo` and
`clearAll` are each a single `set()` of its result, so installing a database WITHOUT the
reset is something the code cannot express — which matters because the Node environment
cannot import `useStore.ts` (it pulls in Dexie via `./idb`), so the unit test proves the
DECISION and the shape protects the WIRING. There are SIX whole-database replacements, not
four: `resetDemo` and `clearAll` are called directly on the store and never touch
`importFullBackup`, so a fix living only there would silently miss two of the three install
points. Deliberate erasure keeps NO guard — those actions are aimed at destroying the data
and already confirm first, so refusing them would be obstruction, not safety.

## Practice totals are calendar figures, not rolling windows

`practiceTotals` / `practiceTotalsByInstrument` / `startOfWeekISODate` (`selectors.ts`,
tested) answer "how much have I practised?" — a compact minutes-and-blocks line low on
Today (BELOW the recommendation, never above: "Practise now" stays above the fold at
390×844) and the full today / this week / all time per-instrument view on Insights. Do NOT
reuse `blocksInWindow`/`totalMinutesInWindow` for these: they filter on HOURS, so `days:1`
means the last 24 hours and `days:7` the last 168 — a block from late last night is not
today's practice. The week starts **Monday 00:00 local**.

**A block belongs WHOLE to the local calendar day it BEGAN**, with none of its minutes
apportioned across midnight or the Monday boundary. This was challenged and the code
settles it: `durationMinutes` is the figure the owner ATTESTED to and this lane makes it
diverge from wall clock on purpose (an abandoned block proposes its target), so
`endedAt - startedAt` is not the authored duration; and `endedAt` is optional and ABSENT on
routine blocks (`applyRoutineRun` passes none), so apportioning would apply to some blocks
and not others. Splitting would overrule the owner's own correction with a number they
never attested to. Totals stay NEUTRAL COUNTS — no goal, streak, score, bar that fills or
colour that judges. Relatedly, `instrumentBalance` takes its denominator from only the
blocks belonging to the instruments it emits rows for, so the percentages sum to 100 when
a caller passes active instruments with all blocks (Today does).

A calendar figure needs a LIVE clock: Today and Insights tick `now` once a minute
(`setInterval` in each page) rather than freezing it at mount, or a screen left open across
midnight keeps reporting yesterday's blocks as today's — and a running block never gains
its stale label. Insights passes ALL of `db.instruments` to `practiceTotalsByInstrument`,
not just the active ones, because its "All instruments" row counts every block: filtering
to active instruments left a retired instrument's history with no row while its minutes
stayed in the total. Rows with no practice are dropped at the call site, so the selector's
"one row per supplied instrument" contract is unchanged.

## Hands-free practice: the screen stays awake, and the app announces the end

The practice loop assumes you put the device down and play. While a practice clock —
an ordinary block (`ActiveBlock`) or a routine run (`RoutineRunner`) — is genuinely
RUNNING and its screen is VISIBLE, the app holds a Screen Wake Lock so the clock stays
readable without touching anything; pausing, finishing, discarding, unmounting
(navigating away) and the document going hidden all release it. WHETHER to hold the
lock is a pure, tested predicate — `shouldKeepAwake({ hasClock, running, visible })`
(`src/domain/practiceSignal.ts`) — true only when all three hold. There is exactly ONE
owner of the lock (`useScreenAwake`, wired once per practice screen), so two can never
be held at once. Reacquiring on `visibilitychange` back to visible is required by the
Screen Wake Lock specification (the platform releases a held lock the moment the
document becomes hidden) — not a browser-specific workaround. No wake-lock outcome,
success, rejection, or unsupported, may ever influence a recorded minute: the whole
elapsed-time family (`sessionElapsedSeconds`, `runElapsedSeconds`, `locateClock`,
`skipCurrentSegment`, `aggregateItemMinutes`) stays exactly as it was before this
existed.

**The decision of WHEN to announce is pure and tested** (`src/domain/practiceSignal.ts`):
`nextSignal(marker, elapsedSeconds, boundarySeconds)` announces AT MOST ONCE per call —
if elapsed has passed more boundaries than the marker records, it announces once and
advances the marker to the number ACTUALLY passed, never by one. This is what makes a
background/lock catch-up correct: a phone that wakes up several boundaries later
announces once and lands on the right one. The marker is a COUNT OF BOUNDARIES ALREADY
ANNOUNCED, living as an optional `signalledThrough?: number` on the store's EPHEMERAL
`active`/`activeRoutine` (useStore.ts) — never in `PracticeDB`, so no `SCHEMA_VERSION`
bump, no migration, and it never syncs or lands in a backup. An ABSENT marker reads as
zero (nothing announced yet) — the honest reading for a session persisted before this
feature existed. Boundaries are the run's ordered cumulative END boundaries: an ordinary
block passes `[targetMinutes * 60]`; a routine passes `segmentBoundaries(segs)`
(`src/domain/routines.ts`) — the SAME numbers `locateClock` advances on, by construction,
not a second cumulative sum recomputed in the runner. A deliberate Skip calls
`acknowledgeThrough` instead, which advances the marker to match elapsed WITHOUT
announcing — the user ended the segment themselves, so telling them it ended is noise —
and clears every boundary at or before elapsed (not just one), since Skip can produce a
zero-length or repeated boundary that is legitimate input, never malformed.

**The visual state change is the guaranteed signal**, always delivered regardless of the
wake lock or any device capability: an ordinary block reaching its target shows a
durable "target reached" ring state and a growing overtime figure
(`formatClock(elapsed - targetSeconds)`) for as long as the block runs — it does NOT
auto-finish; practising past the target is ordinary, and only Finish or Discard ends a
block. A routine segment boundary is perceptible for a defined window after arrival
(never a single-render flash), and routine completion is already durably shown by the
existing "Routine complete" screen. Audio and vibration (`playSignalCue`,
`useScreenAwake.ts`) are FEATURE-DETECTED BEST-EFFORT ONLY, wrapped so any failure is
silent, and are never part of any automated check: `navigator.vibrate` is unimplemented
in Safari on iOS, and a WebAudio context needs a user-gesture unlock that happens on the
page that starts the clock (Today/StageDetail/SessionPlan) — never on the practice
screen itself, which hands-free practice, by definition, never taps. It may therefore be
silent on the owner's own iPhone; the OWNER device checks record what was actually heard
rather than asserting it. Widening the frame to unlock audio at the start gesture is a
separate lane. Neutral and non-gamified throughout: a state change and a number, never a
streak, score, or
celebration.

**The wake lock itself is one shared, port-injected coordinator**
(`src/components/screenAwake.ts`) — no `navigator`/`window`/`document`, so its whole
ownership state machine (at most one outstanding request and one held sentinel; a
rejected or unsupported acquisition swallowed silently; a pending acquisition that
resolves after being disabled released immediately rather than stranded held) is
reachable from an ordinary Node test. `src/components/useScreenAwake.ts` is the thin
React/browser adapter that feature-detects (`'wakeLock' in navigator`) and supplies the
real port, and wires `visibilitychange`.

**Secure-context constraint.** The Screen Wake Lock API requires a secure context.
Production (GitHub Pages) is HTTPS and unaffected. This repo has no branch-preview
deployment — `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` publishes only on push to `main` — so
plain-HTTP LAN serving of an unmerged branch cannot exercise this feature at all
(`navigator.wakeLock` is simply `undefined`, which looks like a bug but is an
environment gap). Before drawing any conclusion about this feature (or any future
secure-context-dependent work) from an unmerged branch, first confirm
`window.isSecureContext` and `'wakeLock' in navigator` on the actual test device, and
establish a genuine HTTPS route for it first.

## Hard "do nots" (require explicit user instruction to change)

- ❌ **No gamification** — no streaks, points, badges, XP, leaderboards, confetti,
  or fake "mastery %". Progress is shown as honest status + result, nothing else.
- ❌ **No backend, no auth server, no service of our own.** The app is local‑first:
  **IndexedDB (Dexie) is the source of truth** on each device (app state in the `kv`
  table, attachment blobs in the `attachments` table) and everything works offline.
  **Amended by explicit user decision (2026‑07‑11):** device sync IS sanctioned — via
  the **user's own GitHub repo**. The engine (`src/store/syncEngine.ts`, port-injected
  and fully unit-tested; GitHub transport in `gitRemote.ts`; wiring in `githubSync.ts`)
  publishes whole snapshots ATOMICALLY with the Git Data API: blobs → tree → commit →
  fast-forward-only ref update, so a race or partial failure never leaves a broken
  remote. A brand-new EMPTY data repo is bootstrapped first via the Contents API
  (`RemotePort.initialize()`) — the git-data endpoints 409 on an empty repo — then the
  first snapshot commits as a child of that bootstrap commit; init failures surface a
  clear message with the manual README fallback and never leave a partial snapshot. Decisions are three-way CONTENT-HASH comparisons (`decideSync` +
  `canonicalStringify`/`hashState` in `src/domain/`), never timestamps — pathway-only
  edits and deletions sync like everything else, and a store middleware
  (`src/store/revision.ts`) bumps a `rev` counter on every db mutation. Both-changed =
  explicit two-button conflict ("newest" is a hint, never an auto-winner), and BOTH
  copies are preserved before any replace: the local copy goes to an in-app restore
  slot (idb) and an `archive/…` branch; the remote copy stays reachable as the parent
  commit. Legacy `state.json`+`files/` remotes stay readable; the first new push
  migrates the format with the old snapshot kept in git history. Never a silent merge,
  never per-field magic, never a custom server. Manual export/import stays as the
  fallback. Free tiers only; no paid services.
- ❌ **No AI or audio analysis** in v1 — no tone scoring, pitch detection, posture
  tracking, or "AI teacher" judgement. The app organises; it does not grade.
- ❌ **No guilt‑driven copy.** Insights are neutral observations, never nags.

## The Pathway is a trust anchor — keep it that way

Pathways exist so the user can **stop deciding what's next and just practise**, at their
own pace, on a route they trust. Protect that:

- **The item is the only unit of work — pathways are a view over items.** There is no
  separate "step" object. A `PracticeItem` may carry a `stageId` (placing it inside a
  pathway stage), a `strand`, and a `catalogKey`. Stage progress is *derived* from the
  mastery status of the items in it (`itemStageState` in `pathways.ts`). Never reintroduce
  a parallel to-do list next to items.
- **The catalog is reference data in code, not persisted.** `pathwaySeed.ts` defines
  per-stage `CatalogEntry` suggestions (gushes, lesson areas) with `about` guidance for
  conscious practice; `addFromCatalog` turns one into a real item with one tap. The new
  item is honestly **"Not practised yet"** (status `new`, zero stats) with an immediate
  Undo — adding is organisation, not progress. Label suggestions as reference aids, never
  canonical. Improving the catalog needs no migration; keep entry keys stable per stage.
- **Adding from the catalog is losslessly reversible.** The Undo is DURABLE (persists until
  dismissed or the item is practised — no timeout), and a fresh catalog item shows a "Remove"
  affordance on its row and in the item's "Connected to". `isLosslesslyRemovable`
  (`pathways.ts`, tested) gates this: `catalogKey` set AND status `new` AND zero blocks AND
  `timesPractised === 0`. The store's `removeCatalogItem` re-checks the predicate against
  LIVE blocks before delegating to `deleteItem`; once anything is logged, only the ordinary
  delete-with-confirm remains. This is the one place a stage row grows a second 44×44 action
  (− beside ▶); it disappears the moment the item is practised.
- **Structure, not gamification.** Show honest position (items solid / in progress /
  suggestions remaining). No streaks, scores, or fabricated mastery %.
- **Pathways/stages stay editable data** (`pathways`, `pathwayStages`, `pathwayRoutines`)
  with full CRUD. Sections are the stages' `group` string (rename via `renameSection`;
  new stages pick their section explicitly). Deleting a stage/pathway must never delete
  items — only detach them, and clear any stale `currentStageId` pin.
- **Routines are ordinary editable data belonging to an instrument** (`src/domain/routines.ts`,
  tested; CRUD in `src/store/useStore.ts`; editor at `src/pages/RoutineEdit.tsx`, route
  `/routine/new` or `/routine/:id/edit`). `PathwayRoutine.instrumentId` is optional at rest
  (a pre-v11 or General-pathway routine may have none — never fabricated) but REQUIRED for
  every routine created from now on; editing an already-unscoped legacy routine (e.g. just
  renaming it) must not invent one either — `RoutineEdit.tsx` defaults the Instrument field
  to the existing routine's own value (possibly none), never to `instruments[0]`, and only a
  brand-new routine requires a choice before Save is enabled. `pathwayId`/`stageId` are
  optional PLACEMENT, not identity, so a routine can exist unplaced ("my Setar warm-up");
  deleting a pathway or stage DETACHES its routines (clears the placement) rather than
  deleting them — pathway deletion clears both `pathwayId` and `stageId`, stage deletion
  clears only `stageId`. `RoutineSegment.itemId` optionally binds a segment to a real
  `PracticeItem`; a bound itemId must always match the routine's instrument, enforced at
  every edge (item deleted → unbind everywhere; item's instrument changes → unbind from
  now-mismatched routines; routine's instrument changes → clear mismatched bindings and
  detach an incompatible placement; pathway's instrument changes → detach an incompatible
  placed routine) — never by silently rewriting either side's instrument. `retargetRoutineInstrument`
  (`routines.ts`) is the one place these invariants are checked, and the store's `addRoutine`/
  `updateRoutine` call it UNCONDITIONALLY on every create and every save, not only when the
  instrument changed — a form is never trusted on faith for bindings or placement it didn't
  actually re-derive. That check also covers a `pathwayId`/`stageId` that doesn't actually
  resolve, not just one whose instrument mismatches: `addRoutine`/`updateRoutine` look up the
  routine's claimed pathway AND stage live and pass both into `retargetRoutineInstrument`,
  which never treats an unresolved `pathwayId` as an unscoped (therefore "compatible") General
  pathway just because the lookup came back `undefined` — a placement pointing at a pathway
  that no longer exists is cleared entirely, and a `stageId` that resolves to a *different*
  pathway's stage is cleared on its own, leaving an otherwise-valid `pathwayId` placement
  untouched. This is deliberately a save-time check, not a live one: editing a
  routine while it is ACTIVELY RUNNING (unbinding an item, changing the instrument) is
  allowed with no "is this active" guard, because `RoutineRunner.tsx` freezes the run's
  segment list (`activeRoutine.authoredSegments`/`segs`) at start and never re-derives it
  from the routine's current data — so a mid-run edit can never shorten or desync the
  in-flight run, and `finishRoutine` still records the genuinely-elapsed minutes against
  whatever item was actually practised. Discarding that instead would silently lose real
  practice, which nothing in this app is allowed to do. Finishing a run writes **at most one
  block per distinct bound item, never one per segment** — `aggregateItemMinutes` sums the
  ACTUAL elapsed running time across every visit to that item's segments (the seeded CGS
  Stage 1 routine repeats "Chunk chords" four times on purpose). The block's result stays
  the factory default `not_logged`: a routine records time, never a judgement, and never
  completes a review or advances SM-2. `focusForItem` (`src/domain/defaults.ts`) is the
  shared strong focus default — the same one `startItemSession` uses — so a routine block
  is indistinguishable from starting that item directly; do not reintroduce a third copy of
  that fallback expression. The run in progress lives in the store as `activeRoutine`
  (ephemeral — never in `PracticeDB`, same shape as `active`/`activePlan`), not component
  state: navigating away (nav-bar tap, browser back) never silently loses genuinely-elapsed
  bound-item practice, matching how an active block already survives navigation, and only
  one routine can run at a time — starting a different one while another is active redirects
  to resume it instead of overwriting its in-flight time. More generally, only ONE practice
  clock of any kind runs at a time, enforced by the START **and** RESUME half of both:
  `startSession` (so `startItemSession` and Session Plan's `beginPlanSegment`, which both
  route through it) and `resumeSession` both refuse while `activeRoutine` is set;
  `startRoutineRun` and `resumeRoutineRun` both refuse while `active` is set — the same
  guard pair in each shared function covers every caller, rather than trusting each page to
  check both. Resume needs the same guard as start: `active`/`activeRoutine` are both
  persisted (`partialize`), so a dual state can reach a device from before this guard
  existed, and resuming either clock without checking the other would tick both at once, the
  same bug as a fresh concurrent start. Without either half, an ordinary block and a routine
  could run concurrently and log the same wall-clock interval twice. Guarding start and resume
  is not enough on its own: those guards only run on an in-app action, but the persisted dual
  state itself re-enters the store on every load through the persist middleware's `merge` —
  the only path by which a whole `active`+`activeRoutine` pair can reach live state without
  going through either guard (`importDB`/`resetDemo`/`clearAll` all explicitly null both, and
  a sync pull replaces only `db`) — so `merge` is the one place this closes for good. If
  `merge` finds both `active` and `activeRoutine` set, it freezes both (the same
  accumulate-and-stop transform `pauseSession`/`pauseRoutineRun` already do): each keeps
  whatever time had genuinely elapsed, but neither is left `running` with a live timestamp to
  keep ticking from, so a stale dual state can never silently double-log time going FORWARD
  again. The historical overlap up to the moment of the freeze is deliberately left on both
  sides rather than guessed away — there is no way to know from the data alone which of the
  two was the "real" one, and discarding either would silently lose genuinely-elapsed practice,
  which nothing in this app is allowed to do; it becomes a stale pair the ordinary finish/
  discard flow (and then the same start/resume guards) makes the user resolve one of, same as
  any other unclosed block. `RoutineRunner.tsx`'s "an ordinary block is already running"
  redirect applies even to the routine the store considers "mine": once both can exist as a
  frozen (not just running) pair, showing the routine screen just because it's the active one
  would land the user on a Resume button that silently no-ops (`resumeRoutineRun` refuses
  while `active` exists) — redirecting unconditionally to `/active` gives one deterministic
  screen to resolve first, instead of a dead button on whichever screen they happened to load.
  The pages that start a
  clock (`Today.tsx`, `StageDetail.tsx`, `RoutineRunner.tsx`, and — for the out-of-scope
  pages that still `navigate('/active')` after a now-blocked start — `ActiveBlock.tsx`
  itself) resolve the conflict by redirecting to whichever clock is actually running instead
  of leaving the user on a dead screen. `RoutineRunner.tsx` derives
  remaining time from a wall-clock elapsed-seconds value (`runElapsedSeconds`/`locateClock`
  in `routines.ts`), the same accumulated-plus-live-since-a-timestamp shape as
  `sessionElapsedSeconds` — so pausing genuinely freezes it and a backgrounded/locked phone
  catches up across MULTIPLE segment boundaries at once rather than losing time or advancing
  one tick at a time. Skip clamps the current segment's effective duration to whatever
  actually elapsed (never the full authored minutes); a segment played to completion keeps
  its full duration. Choosing "short on time" (`segmentsForRun`) drops every non-essential
  segment, honouring the syllabus's asterisk rule. "Finish routine" (mid-run) always saves
  whatever bound-item time has genuinely elapsed via the same `finishRoutine` path as natural
  completion — never a separate discard — with a caption stating that plainly, since ending
  early must never silently fabricate or silently lose practice. Today's Routines card is
  documented in its own bullet above.
- **The current stage is the user's choice.** Teacher-led work jumps around:
  `Pathway.currentStageId` (pin) always wins; "first incomplete stage" is only the
  fallback. Never treat linear order as truth for Setar/Tar.
- **Pieces can have parts** (`parentItemId`): parts are ordinary items grouped under a
  piece/étude, with a deterministic "practise this part now" pick (`pickNextPart`) and a
  calm stall hint (`stallHint`) — smaller unit or new strategy, never quotas.
- **"My repertoire" is a DERIVED lens, not new structure.** Repertoire has exactly
  three views: **Pathways · My repertoire · Practice list**. A "work" is any top-level
  item with Persian identity (dastgāh/form/composer/gusheh) or a full piece/gusheh type
  (`isWork`/`repertoireWorks` in `src/domain/repertoire.ts`, tested). Persian works
  group by dastgāh via `groupByDastgah` (`src/domain/persian.ts` — folds spelling
  variants, labels with the user's own majority spelling, standard dastgāh order) with
  radif gushehs and composed maestro pieces side by side; other instruments group by
  study source. Parent works appear ONCE; parts stay nested (never standalone
  duplicates). Form/composer are compact metadata + filter chips, never a deep
  hierarchy. Dastgāh/form suggestions are datalists (reference aids), free text always
  wins. Never invent a parallel "pieces" object or a guitar-specific model.
- **Sources stay simple.** A Material is instrument + one clear name + kind + status +
  note. Piece-level detail (dastgāh, gusheh, composer, teacher) belongs on items, never
  on sources — the removed parent-title/section/teacher-source fields must not return.
  Sources are reached from Repertoire (not More), and are creatable inline from the
  item form.
- **Seeds are honest starting points, never fabricated authority.** Guitar = CGS. Setar =
  a radif/dastgāh map (teacher-driven, explicitly "reorder me"). Tar = the Honarestān
  method. Dastgāh intros use standard characterisations; per-gushe `about` text stays a
  generic conscious-practice prompt (shāhed / ist / forud) — the teacher's account is the
  authority, never invent specifics as if canonical.
- **Calm, self-paced copy.** "Move on when it feels right, not by a deadline" is the voice.

## Lessons (classes) and the deadline exception

`Lesson` records (per instrument, date + free-form notes) support the user's real
workflow: record the class, rewatch it, type up notes (often **in Farsi** — all free-text
fields must stay direction-aware; `unicode-bidi: plaintext` handles this globally), then
create/link the concrete practice items (`lesson.itemIds` — a link, never ownership;
unlinking keeps the item). "Originated in this lesson" (`itemIds`) is separate from
"work on before the next class" (`assignedForLesson`), which gives a per-instrument
priority boost that climbs as that instrument's next lesson approaches
(`lessonUrgencyScore`). This is the one sanctioned "deadline" in the app — a monthly
class is a real commitment, not a manufactured streak. Keep it per-instrument and
generic (future Tar/Guitar teachers), never guilt-toned. Attachments belong to an item
OR a lesson (`AttachmentMeta.ownerType/ownerId`; blobs keyed by `ownerId` in Dexie) for
SMALL files (PDFs/photos/short audio, size-capped). **Full class videos — and score
PDFs/docs — are NAS references, never bytes:** `Lesson.recordings` (`LessonRecording`)
holds title + a relative NAS path (or full https URL) + size/notes + an optional `kind`
(`LessonFileKind` = video/pdf/doc/audio; schema **v9** stamps legacy refs `kind:'video'`).
`resolveRecording` (`src/domain/recordings.ts`, tested) returns a discriminated
`ok|no-base|bad-base|empty` result — the scheme-less-base bug is fixed by
`normalizeBaseUrl` (prepends `https://`, rejects non-http(s), validates via `new URL`);
`resolveRecordingUrl`/`needsBaseUrl` are thin wrappers. It joins the ref under the
per-device NAS base URL (Settings, localStorage) and opens only on explicit tap — never at
startup, never in IndexedDB/sync/backups; a `bad-base` never `window.open`s. Removing a
reference never touches the NAS file. Lessons carry an optional `number`
(`nextLessonNumber` prefills it, editable, never required; shown as "Class N · date"); refs
render video-first then scores/docs with kind icons. The user's Setar class history imports
additively via `buildSetarClassLessons` (`src/domain/setarClasses.ts`, tested) →
`importSetarClasses`, which also **backfills** missing refs (video + one per PDF/doc,
path-deduped) onto already-imported lessons — idempotent. `SETAR_CLASS_SESSIONS` lives
between `// [scan:begin]`/`// [scan:end]` markers and is regenerated from the real NAS
folder by `npm run scan:setar` (`scripts/scan-setar-classes.mjs`, stdlib, dry-run by
default; pure helpers unit-tested) — references only, never copying bytes.

## Questions for next class

`questionsForNextClass` (`src/domain/questions.ts`, tested) collects items where
`assignedForLesson === true` AND `teacherQuestion` is non-empty, scoped to one
instrument, ordered by the Persian collator. Shown on the upcoming lesson and the
Teacher Report with Copy / Download / print-friendly export (`ClassQuestions`). A
question is NEVER auto-cleared by practising; the user edits the item to remove it.

## Persian text is canonical, and direction-aware

Built-in Setar/Tar data (pathway/section/stage names, catalogue gushehs, forms,
composers, study sources, seeded items) is authored in **Farsi**; generic app UI and
Classical Guitar stay English. STABLE ascii identifiers are decoupled from Farsi
display: `StageSeed.slug` / `StepSeed.key` in `pathwaySeed.ts` keep stage ids and
catalog keys byte-stable (fall back to `slug(code)`/`slug(title)` for English seeds), so
the Farsi conversion needs no migration. `src/domain/farsi.ts` (tested) provides
`normalizePersian` (fold Arabic↔Persian yeh/kaf, digits, ZWNJ, whitespace — preserves
آ), `faCollator` for sorting, and Latin transliteration aliases for search
(`persianSearchMatch`); `groupByDastgah` folds spelling variants and ranks by Farsi or
Latin dastgāh names. All Farsi surfaces use `dir="auto"` + the global
`unicode-bidi: plaintext`.

## Review scheduling stays explainable

`computeReview` (in `scheduling.ts`) is an **SM-2 spaced-repetition engine** adapted to
music: per item it tracks `srReps` / `srEase` / `srIntervalDays`; good reviews expand the
interval, a slip resets it, and importance/difficulty pull material a little sooner. It
supports per-item overrides (Auto / fixed cadence / Manual) and returns a plain `rationale`.
Keep it deterministic and explainable — don't turn it into an opaque model, and keep the
SM-2 tests green. Item status labels are plain-language for the user — keep the enum keys
stable and only change the display labels in `labels.ts`.

**The engine is visible AND adjustable, never magic.** `SchedulingParams`
(`src/domain/types.ts`) holds bounded knobs — the SM-2 first/second/slip-reset gaps and
the Session Plan minute shares — persisted as an OPTIONAL `PracticeDB.settings` (schema
**v10**; `undefined ⇒ DEFAULT_SCHEDULING_PARAMS`, so old backups import unchanged and
`validateDB` carries the field through). `DEFAULT_SCHEDULING_PARAMS` reproduces the
historical constants EXACTLY — `computeReview`/`planNextReview` take an optional `params`
whose default is byte-identical to before (a snapshot test guards this). Every call site
that shows OR persists a date must thread the SAME params (`db.settings`): the store into
`closeSession`, `CloseBlock` into both preview calls — the date shown must equal the date
saved. `clampSchedulingParams` enforces the bounds (never trust raw input). Settings' "How
scheduling works" section states the real priority formula and the SM-2 rungs in plain
English with live values, offers bounded inputs + "Reset to recommended", and CloseBlock's
review row links to it ("Why this date?").

## The Session Plan is a view over real blocks, not a new to-do list

The Session Plan (`src/domain/plan.ts`, pure + fully tested; `/plan` page) lays out one
time-budgeted session for the current instrument: ordered segments in five buckets
(`warmup · lesson · review · deep · cooldown`), each with minutes, a mode/focus, and a
one-sentence reason. It **reuses the same `scoreItems` priority numbers** as the
recommendation engine — no second, hidden ranking. It is organisation, never judgement:
no scores, no "optimal" claims, no gamification.

- **The invariant: segment minutes ALWAYS sum to the budget** (`buildSessionPlan`,
  `allocateMinutes` — largest-remainder split, min 2/segment, drops the lowest-priority
  segments when the budget can't seat them all). Keep it deterministic (explicit `now`,
  stable score-desc-then-id tiebreaks) and keep the sum==budget tests green across
  15/20/30/45/60 and the edge cases (0 items, 1 item, all-saturated, everything
  practised-today → falls back and says so). `redistributePlan`/`swapSegment` are the pure
  editors; the preview page tweaks a LOCAL copy before `startPlan`.
- **The plan runs REAL practice blocks — it is not a countdown.** `RoutineRunner` (the
  warm-up timer) stays untouched. The runner orchestrates the existing
  start→`/active`→`/close` flow: "Start this segment" = `beginPlanSegment` seeded from the
  segment (its minutes become the target). `closeSession` has a tail that, when a plan is
  running and the closed block was the current segment, marks it `done` and advances the
  pointer — **the plain flow (no active plan) is byte-identical to before.** Skipping logs
  nothing. Practising is still the only thing that completes a review / advances SM-2.
- **The running plan is EPHEMERAL** — `activePlan` + `planMinutesByInstrument` live in the
  store (persisted via `partialize`), **never in `PracticeDB`, so no schema bump and it
  never syncs/backs-up as data.**
- **Today's plan card stays collapsed (~50px) above "Practise now"** so the primary
  recommendation stays above the fold at 390×844 (verified). It becomes "Resume your plan"
  while one runs. The evidence behind the bucket shape (spacing, interleaving, retrieval
  practice, end-on-stability) is cited soberly in `plan.ts` and `DECISIONS.md` — sane
  defaults, adjustable via `SchedulingParams`, never dressed up as an optimum.

## Device & infrastructure

**MacBook-first in daily use** (laptop open while practising — notes, files, webcam as
mirror), iPhone as the companion; the phone constraint still binds (primary
recommendation above the fold at 390×844). Both run the **same installed PWA** served
from **GitHub Pages** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` publishes `dist/` on every push to
main; the repo is public by explicit user decision, 2026‑07‑11 — the user does not need
the app or data private). Prod base `/practice-compass/` (override with `PC_BASE`)
matches the Pages project path. CI (`ci.yml`) still gates lint + tests + build. The
installed PWA works fully offline; hosting reliability only affects updates.
`scripts/deploy-nas.sh` remains an OPTIONAL LAN mirror — never the primary, and no
Tailscale requirement in the main flow.

**Devices sync via the user's GitHub data repo** (Settings → Sync): on app open, after
30 quiet seconds following changes (rev-driven), on returning online, and manually.
Status shows device name, last sync, current revision + short content hash, plain
errors, and a "restore archived copy" recovery action. The UI must stay honest about
the model: whole snapshots, hash-compared, explicit conflicts, both sides preserved.
The PAT is scoped to the single data repo (Contents R/W) and lives only in
localStorage — never in backups or synced data.

**Attachment size policy is enforced, not claimed** (`attachmentPolicy` in
`src/domain/files.ts`, tested): warn over 10 MB and for any video, refuse over 40 MB
with a clear message. Class videos live on the NAS as recording references, never the app.

**Hybrid storage — keep the roles distinct (Settings explains them):** LOCAL data
(IndexedDB) is the source of truth and works offline. GITHUB SYNC is the small,
versioned multi-device state transport — one private data repo per app that genuinely
needs it; a phone-only app uses local + NAS backup and needs no GitHub repo. NAS BACKUP
is the user's own independent full export — never treat sync git history as the only
backup. NAS RECORDINGS hold the large videos the other three must never carry. Do not
replace GitHub sync with a NAS backend, and do not fold recordings into sync/backup.

**The app shell is a fixed-height flex column and only `<main>` scrolls** — nothing is
`position: fixed/sticky`, so the nav bar cannot drift. The shell height is **`100dvh`
(dynamic viewport) with a `100vh` fallback via `@supports`**, NOT `height: 100%`: in an
installed iOS PWA with `viewport-fit=cover`, `100%` resolves to the layout viewport
which stops above the home-indicator safe area, leaving the bar floating above the
physical bottom with dead space beneath. With `100dvh` the shell reaches the true
bottom and the bar's own `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` padding lifts just its buttons
clear. **The iOS software keyboard must not drift the shell:** `useViewportGuard`
(`src/components/useViewportGuard.ts`, wired once in `Layout`) listens to `visualViewport`
and, when no editable is focused, resets any layout-viewport displacement to 0; on focus it
scrolls the field into `<main>` instead. It is a no-op without `visualViewport` and must
stay pure glue — never restructure the shell to "fix" the keyboard. Five EQUAL nav tabs
(no raised centre button — Today owns the primary Start
action); route changes scroll `<main>` to top; per-route page widths (narrow for focused
practice, wide ~1100px for browsing/notes on desktop); serif is for headings only,
controls/nav/metadata are sans. Pathway catalogue rows use a stable
`[state · minmax(0,1fr) · one 44×44 action]` grid so adding a suggestion swaps only the
action icon (+→▶) without reflowing the text; status shows once (no duplicate badge);
detach lives in the item's "Connected to", not the row. The service worker registers in PROMPT mode: updates show an in-app "new version
→ Reload" banner (checked hourly and on visibilitychange) and the build stamp
(`__APP_VERSION__`) is visible in Settings — reinstalling is never the update path.
The public build ships a restrictive CSP meta (self + api.github.com only), injected
at build time (`cspPlugin` in vite.config.ts). Pages deploys ONLY behind lint + tests
+ build (deploy.yml single dependency chain).

**Canonical names in user-facing copy:** practice item (the only unit of work) ·
Study source (where an item comes from: radif, method book, collection, course,
teacher handout — nothing else) · Pathways / My repertoire / Practice list (the three
Repertoire views) · "Add practice item" (full form) · "Based on / reference" (a
pathway's provenance) · "Connect it (optional)" (the links group). A practice item may
link to a study source, a stage, lessons and a parent work at once; links never
duplicate the item.

## Architecture rules

- **Domain logic stays pure.** Everything in `src/domain/` must be free of React and
  side effects, and must take an explicit `now: Date` instead of calling `new Date()`
  internally. This keeps it deterministic and unit‑testable.
- **The recommendation engine stays deterministic and explainable.** Every recommended
  card must produce a one‑sentence reason from the same numbers that ranked it. No
  hidden heuristics, no models.
- **The store is the only place that mutates app data.** UI components call store actions;
  they never touch IndexedDB or rebuild domain objects by hand. Attachment **blobs** are the
  one exception: they live in IndexedDB via `src/store/idb.ts` and the `attachments.ts`
  service (too big for the reactive JSON); only their lightweight metadata sits in the store.
- **Storage is async.** The store hydrates from IndexedDB after load; `App` gates render on
  `hydrated`. Every inbound database — rehydration, manual import, sync pull,
  conflict-keep-remote, archive restore — runs through the one shared `migrateToCurrent`
  chain (`src/domain/migrations.ts`); persistence changes must keep it green and bump
  `SCHEMA_VERSION`. Schema **v11** backfills a routine's `instrumentId` from the pathway
  it belonged to — but only when that pathway names an instrument that actually resolves
  in `db.instruments` (a General pathway, a legacy empty-string id, or a dangling
  reference all leave the routine honestly unscoped rather than inventing one), and never
  overwrites a routine that already has one.
- **One file per route** under `src/pages/`. Shared UI primitives live in
  `src/components/`. Pure helpers go in their own non‑component modules (this also keeps
  React Fast Refresh and the `react-refresh` lint rule happy).

## When you add a feature

1. Add/extend the **types** in `src/domain/types.ts` and bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` if the
   persisted shape changes (add a migration in the store's `persist` config).
2. Put the logic in a **pure domain module** with **tests** (`*.test.ts`). The required
   coverage — priority scoring, recommendation selection, review scheduling, stat
   updates, saturation — must stay green.
3. Only then wire up the UI.
4. Run `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` and fix everything before finishing.

## Tests are not optional

`npm test` must pass. The suite guards the behaviour that makes the recommendations
trustworthy; if you change the scoring formula or scheduling intervals, update the tests
in the same change and make sure they still describe correct behaviour.

## Roadmap items are allowed (they were designed for)

Audio recording attachment, PWA offline install, CSV export, calendar reminders, a
simple audio note per block, teacher‑sharing PDF. These extend the tool without breaking
the philosophy. Anything that contradicts the "do nots" above needs an explicit decision
from the user, recorded here.
