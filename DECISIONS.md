## The content leads: direction on the group, and a colour list that is bounded on purpose (2026-09-11)

**Direction lives on the GROUP, never on the title.** `dir="auto"` was on 47 title
elements and on no container anywhere, so a Farsi title resolved RTL and hugged the right
edge of its cell while its own English caption hugged the left. The fix is not a new
mechanism — it is moving the SAME native attribute up one level, to the element that
holds a title together with the details belonging to it. Two consequences are worth
recording because they are not obvious:

1. `dir="auto"` resolves from the FIRST STRONG CHARACTER in the subtree, so where an
   English eyebrow precedes the title in the DOM (Today's Practise-now card, the close
   screen's header, Session Plan's minutes/bucket line) the group is drawn around
   title + details and the eyebrow is deliberately left OUTSIDE it. Wrapping the whole
   card would pin the group LTR and change nothing.
2. Direction alone does not move text. Several groups sit under an ancestor pinning
   `text-align: left` (a picker row button, the practice screen's centred column), and
   `left` is inherited as a COMPUTED value — it does not re-resolve per element. Those
   groups set `text-align: start` on themselves.

The sweep is held closed by `src/components/direction.test.ts` rather than by care, and
its exception allowlist came out EMPTY: every title on every surface had a group it could
join. `PathwayDetail`'s stage rows were the candidate exception (an ascii-looking code
like "2A" leading a Farsi title) — but the Setar and Tar seeds author stage codes in
Farsi (`نشست`, `شور`, `ماهور`), so grouping code + title is both correct and what the
owner actually sees. Even where a group DOES resolve LTR from its code, that is the point:
the code and the title then agree instead of pointing at opposite edges.

**The colour list is bounded, and the planner's "six failing tokens" was an undercount.**
The plan measured each foreground token against `--bg` only. Two tokens fail there and
were missed (`--tone-progress` 4.41, `--tone-rest` 4.26), and more importantly `--bg` is
not where several of them RENDER: `--tone-rest` only ever appears as `.badge`/`.chip`
text over its own translucent `--tone-rest-soft` fill. `src/styles/contrast.test.ts`
therefore lists the pairs each token is ACTUALLY rendered on, compositing a translucent
fill over the card it sits in, and asserts them in all three palette blocks.

That honest list moves EIGHT light tokens (`--text-faint`, `--accent`, `--gold`,
`--tone-alert`, `--tone-warn`, `--tone-progress`, `--tone-good`, `--tone-rest`) and FOUR
dark ones (`--text-faint`, `--tone-alert`, `--tone-progress`, `--tone-rest`) rather than
the six + one the plan predicted. The list was NOT trimmed to make that arithmetic come
out right: an uncovered token is supposed to be a visible omission, and dropping badges
would have left two of the five tone tokens with no coverage at all. Three of the four
dark moves are 1–7 units and imperceptible. `--accent-contrast` (white on the primary
Start button, 3.95 at HEAD) needed no move of its own — darkening `--accent` to clear AA
against the page took that pair to 5.94. Every `-soft` fill, `--text`, `--text-dim` and
`--accent-dim` are untouched, because they pass.

**Both light blocks, every time.** `global.css` declares the light palette twice — at
`:root[data-theme='light']` and again inside `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light)
{ :root:not([data-theme]) }`. The duplicate is what an owner who never picked a theme
sees, so the test asserts both blocks AND that they agree token for token.

**Reading the stylesheet needed a workaround, not a config change.** `src` is typechecked
by `tsconfig.app.json`, which does not enable node types, and Vitest blanks every `.css`
module — `?raw` included — unless `test.css` is on in `vite.config.ts`. Both files are
outside this lane's scope. So the contrast test reads the real file through a dynamic
import whose specifier the compiler cannot resolve statically. Reading the REAL file is
the whole point: a table of colours copied into the test would keep passing while the app
shipped something else. The direction test needs no such trick — `import.meta.glob` with
`?raw` works for `.tsx`, and a glob also means a NEW page is swept in automatically.

**One ReviewPlan on the close screen.** The collapsed summary line and the expanded date
field are two renderings of ONE value, with a manual correction folded into it rather
than held beside it. The guarantee had to be structural: `CloseBlock` previously called
`planNextReview` twice (once for the preview hint, once inside `pickResult` to seed the
field), which is exactly the drift r-explainable-scheduling exists to prevent. A pure
formatter (`reviewSummaryLine`) renders the line and computes nothing, so a divergent
date is unrepresentable rather than merely remembered about.

**Today's order was built the other way round, tried, and REVERTED — by design.** The
lane built Practise now directly under the instrument switcher with Plan and Routines as
two compact peer doorways beneath it, on the argument that orchestrating a session is a
choice you make INSTEAD of taking the suggestion. It shipped as one ordering change with
no data or state implication precisely so the owner's own device could settle it. It did:
on 2026-09-11 the owner judged the original order better — Plan and Routines read as
belonging at the top of the page, and recommendation-first felt less natural — so the
order went back. That reversal is a PASSING outcome of the check, not a failure of the
lane, and everything else the lane built stands.

Worth recording for whoever reads the code next: BOTH orders keep the recommendation
above the fold at 390×844, so nothing about this ordering follows from the phone
constraint or from any other rule in AGENTS.md. It is a taste judgement that only the
owner can make, and the argument for recommendation-first is genuinely available to
re-derive — which is exactly why `Today.tsx` and AGENTS.md now say, in so many words,
not to act on it without asking.

**Rejection findings, addressed (fresh review, 2026-09-11).** A sealed fresh review of
this lane's diff returned `request_changes` against two families, fixed comprehensively
rather than by patching the two cited examples:

1. **Mixed-content groups and completeness.** Grouping a Farsi title with an
   ALWAYS-ENGLISH generated detail (`buildReason`, `planSegmentReason`) under one
   `dir="auto"` fixed the ALIGNMENT but broke the detail's own bidi ordering: the Farsi
   title's resolved RTL base became the detail's base too, and FriBidi renders a trailing
   neutral character (the sentence's own full stop) using that base when nothing more
   specific claims it — so it visually jumped to the start. Fixed by nesting a
   `dir="ltr"` isolate around each such detail (Today's Practise-now card and secondary
   recommendations, ItemDetail's "practise this part now", Session Plan's segment
   list and runner) — grouping and alignment are unchanged, only the isolate's own
   internal ordering is fixed. A structurally identical bug existed the other way round
   for FREE TEXT the owner typed after a fixed English label (ActiveBlock's
   `constraint`/`problem`, "last time you decided to try"): the label was the subtree's
   first strong text, so `dir="auto"` on the whole line resolved from the label and never
   saw the owner's own (possibly Farsi) words — fixed the same way the codebase already
   excludes an eyebrow, by giving the VALUE its own nested `dir="auto"` and leaving the
   label outside it. Today's Routines doorway had the same eyebrow-first bug at the
   button level ("Resume your routine"/"Routines" decided the direction, not the routine's
   own name) — fixed by moving `dir="auto"` off the button and onto a block wrapper
   around just the name, mirroring the shape `ElsewhereSessions` already used a few lines
   above it (an inline `<span>` there would silently break `.truncate`'s ellipsis, since
   `overflow`/`text-overflow` do nothing on a non-replaced inline box). ActiveBlock's
   header stayed CENTRED despite the contract requiring Farsi right / English left on that
   screen — the page's own `text-align: center` (correct for the timer ring and buttons)
   was never overridden for the title group; it now sets `text-align: start` on itself,
   which is a deliberate LAYOUT CHANGE for English on that one screen and is documented in
   AGENTS.md as not conflicting with "English keeps its layout" elsewhere (that non-goal
   guards against a Farsi-style right-align, not against ac-6's explicit left-for-English
   requirement on Active).

   The COMPLETENESS gap: `direction.test.ts`'s "every surface has a group" check passed
   as long as ONE group survived anywhere in the file, so deleting the Practise-now card's
   own `dir="auto"` still passed because Today.tsx has several unrelated groups. Fixed
   with `GROUP_SITE_INVENTORY` — every group-level site recorded in order, duplicates
   included, asserted with `toEqual` against the live scan, so removing any ONE recorded
   site anywhere fails regardless of what else survives in the same file. Building that
   inventory surfaced a second, unrelated defect in the scanner itself: this file's own
   prose repeatedly writes the literal string `dir="auto"` in comments, and the naive
   regex scan matched those too — usually producing a site with no real enclosing tag, but
   at least once walking backward out of a long comment and mis-attributing an unrelated
   component tag from elsewhere in the file as if it were the match's real element. The
   scanner now strips `//` and `/* */` comments (copying string/template literals through
   verbatim, since that is where a REAL `dir="auto"` attribute value lives) before
   matching.

2. **CloseBlock manual-date preservation.** `pickResult` cleared the manual `override` on
   every result change — correct when the engine actually re-plans (a fresh judgement
   deserves a fresh plan, not a stale correction pinned to the old one), wrong when it
   doesn't: a manual-mode item (`item.reviewMode === 'manual'`) has no automatic plan for
   ANY result, so a date the owner had just typed in was never tied to a particular
   judgement, and clearing it turned a deliberate "come back on this date" into an
   accidental decline the moment they picked a different result. Fixed by gating the
   clear on `reviewOverrideSurvivesResultChange(item.reviewMode)`
   (`src/components/format.ts`) rather than calling `planNextReview` a second time inside
   `pickResult` — CloseBlock's single `ReviewPlan` derivation is unchanged; this is a
   boolean read of the item's own mode, not a second value that could disagree with it.
   The predicate is tested against the real engine across all six results for both a
   manual- and an auto-mode item, not asserted in prose alone.

## Serving NAS class recordings over HTTPS (Task 3, 2026-07; CORRECTED 2026-09-10)

**Problem.** The app runs on an HTTPS origin (GitHub Pages). Class videos and scores
live on the Synology NAS under `homes/ethan/SNDK/video-courses` (on disk:
`/volume1/homes/ethan/SNDK/video-courses`). A lesson reference stores a *relative*
path (e.g. `setar-classes/session-1-…/video.mp4`); the app joins it under a **NAS
base URL** set in Settings. Two things must be true for playback:

1. The base URL must be a real `https://` origin. (A scheme-less value like
   `ds220plus.taild1d1f7.ts.net` was previously concatenated raw and treated as a
   *relative* URL against the Pages origin — so every recording opened the same
   in-app 404. Fixed in `normalizeBaseUrl` / `resolveRecording`,
   `src/domain/recordings.ts`.)
2. The folder must be served over HTTPS. DSM on `:5000` does **not** serve raw
   files, and plain `http://` links are mixed content that iOS blocks.

**What is ACTUALLY running (probed 2026-09-10, and this corrects what this record
used to claim).** This file previously recorded *Tailscale Serve on the Synology* as
the chosen mechanism, with a runbook. That is **not** what is in place, and an agent
following that runbook would have configured the wrong thing:

- There is **no Tailscale CLI and no Tailscale.app on this Mac**.
- `https://192.168.0.20:5010/` answers **HTTP 200 from nginx** and already serves
  **real browsable directory listings** (mod_autoindex-style "Index of /"), whose
  document root IS the `video-courses` folder — it lists `setar-classes/`,
  `tar-classes/` and `classical-guitar/`, and `/setar-classes/` answers 200. So the
  existing relative references already resolve against it, and a **Browse** link
  needs no server change whatsoever; the capability was already there and unused.
- The certificate is Synology's own default (`CN=synology`, issuer
  `Synology Inc. CA`) and does **not** match `192.168.0.20`. That is why this works
  on the MacBook, where the exception has been accepted, and why **each new device
  must accept the certificate once** before NAS links open there. A certificate
  prompt on the iPhone is INFRASTRUCTURE, not an app defect.

**Current base URL:** `https://192.168.0.20:5010` (LAN only).

**The app is deliberately TRANSPORT-AGNOSTIC, and that is now enforced rather than
hoped for.** A reference pasted from the NAS listing is stored **relative** to the
configured base (`relativizeReference`, `recordings.ts`, tested) instead of as the
absolute URL the browser gave you. An absolute URL would pin that reference to one
route to the NAS — dead on a phone away from home, and dead everywhere the day the
base URL changes. Because only the path is stored, **choosing the transport is a
decision that can be changed later without rewriting a single stored reference.**

**That choice is deliberately left OPEN.** Staying on the LAN address, moving to
Tailscale (`ts.net` gives a valid certificate and tailnet-only access; Go's file
server supports Range requests, so video seeking works), or putting a reverse proxy
in front are all still available. Whichever is chosen, only the Settings base URL
changes.

**Rejected alternatives.** WebDAV (auth prompts break iOS inline video); per-file
File Station share links (unmaintainable — one link per file). Also deliberately NOT
built: a `scan:nas` index feeding an in-app file picker — the NAS already renders
browsable listings, so browse → copy → paste closes most of the gap without adding a
build script, a generated reference module, a staleness story and a Mac-only
dependency. Revisit only if browsing and pasting proves insufficient in real use.

**Never modify the recordings themselves** — the app only stores references, and
removing a reference never touches the NAS file.

## Session Plan — algorithm & evidence (2026-07-18)

The Session Plan (`src/domain/plan.ts`) lays out a time-budgeted session as ordered
segments in five buckets (warm-up · lesson · review · deep · cool-down). It reuses the
recommendation engine's `scoreItems` — no second ranking — and is pure and deterministic.

**Decisions.**
- **Minutes always sum to the budget.** A largest-remainder split by bucket weight, each
  segment ≥ 2 min; when the budget can't seat every segment, the lowest-priority ones are
  dropped before allocation. This is the one load-bearing invariant and is tested across
  15/20/30/45/60 and the edge cases.
- **The plan runs REAL blocks, not a countdown.** The runner drives the existing
  start→active→close flow; `closeSession` advances the plan only when the closed block was
  the current segment. `RoutineRunner` (the warm-up timer) is deliberately left untouched.
- **The running plan is ephemeral** (store-only, never in `PracticeDB`) so it never syncs
  or lands in a backup as data.
- **Shares are sane defaults, adjustable, never "optimal".** Bucket minute shares come from
  `SchedulingParams` (Settings) — the app makes no claim of an ideal ratio.

**Evidence (used as rationale for the SHAPE, not as precise prescriptions).**
- Spacing effect → short, spaced segments + SM-2 (Cepeda et al. 2006; Simmons 2012).
- Contextual interference / interleaving → the no-adjacent-same-item mix and the "it feels
  harder; that's the point" framing (Shea & Morgan 1979; Carter & Grahn 2016; Stambaugh 2011).
- Retrieval practice → short review slots (Roediger & Karpicke 2006).
- Deliberate, goal-directed practice → one focus per segment (Ericsson et al. 1993;
  Duke, Simmons & Cash 2009).
- Sleep consolidation → cool-down / end-on-stability (Simmons & Duke 2006).

No claim of an optimal minute ratio is made; the shares are defaults the user can adjust.
