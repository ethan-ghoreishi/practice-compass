# Decisions

Durable record of non-obvious choices. Newest first.

## Seventh rejection: the ROW's own alignment must come from the value, not an inherited direction (2026-09-13)

A seventh sealed finding, checked on the owner's own iPhone, found the sixth rejection's
`display: 'inline-block'` fix for `ClassQuestions`' `Problem:`/`Last time:` rows still
wrong — not merely incomplete. That fix gave the VALUE its own bidi character order and
its own wrap-line alignment, but left the ROW that positions "Label: value" as a unit
BARE, so the row inherited whichever direction the TITLE above it resolved to — right for
a Farsi title, left for an English one — regardless of what script the value was actually
written in. For the common case (title and value the same language) this looked correct
by coincidence; for an English-titled item with a Farsi problem note, the whole row
stayed pinned left, exactly where the inherited direction put it, with the value's
internal shaping correct but its POSITION wrong. This is the same root cause the
"A GROUP CARRYING DIRECTION IS NOT THE SAME CLAIM AS EVERY CHILD IN IT HAVING ITS OWN"
section already named for other files, just not yet applied to a LABEL-plus-VALUE row.

Fixed by moving `dir="auto"` from the value to the ROW itself, and marking the LABEL —
never the value — with its own `dir="ltr"`. This is not because the label's text ever
changes; `dir="auto"` skips a descendant that carries its own `dir` when hunting for a
first strong character, so marking the label takes it OUT of that hunt and leaves the
(deliberately bare) value as the row's only resolution source. Marking the value too
would take BOTH out, leaving the row with nothing to resolve from and a silent fallback
to LTR regardless of the value's own script — confirmed to fail the new test when tried.
Verified across all four combinations (Farsi/English title × Farsi/English value) at both
a narrow (350px, iPhone-card-width) and a wide (700px, desktop) container: a value's own
language now determines its row's alignment independently of the title, in both
directions, at both widths. This also resolved the number/title "detachment" the same
finding reported: with all four lines (title, question, Problem, Last time) correctly
right-aligning together, the block reads as one coherent unit against the marker instead
of two aligned lines and two stray ones.

`direction.test.ts` replaces the `ISOLATED_VALUE_SITES` ledger entries for these rows
with a shape check, `isLabelFirstAutoRow` / "a label-first auto row's value stays bare":
any `dir="auto"` group whose body opens with a `<span dir="ltr">…</span>` must have no
other `dir=` anywhere else in its body, or the row has nothing left to resolve from. It is
a SHAPE check, not a ClassQuestions-specific one, so it would catch the same regression in
any future file using this pattern. Two mutations were confirmed to fail before this was
committed: marking the value `dir="auto"` too (caught by the new check and by
`GROUP_SITE_INVENTORY`'s exact-order equality), and removing the label's `dir="ltr"`
entirely — reverting to the original bug — which the PRE-EXISTING `unexemptedPhrase` check
also catches on its own (the bare "Problem" label plus the value's opaque expression reads
as a 2-word exposed phrase), giving this shape two independent guards.

## Sixth rejection: a native marker is removed, not accommodated; a value's alignment is its own (2026-09-13)

A sixth sealed finding, checked on the owner's own iPhone, found `ClassQuestions.tsx`'s
question number still escaping the card despite the third rejection's symmetric
`paddingInline` fix — proof that an outside `::marker`'s exact position for a
direction-variable `<li>` is a browser implementation detail no gutter measurement can
guarantee (jsdom cannot compute it either, which is why a padding proxy was ever trusted
to stand in for it). Fixed by removing the native marker mechanism entirely rather than
reserving room for it: `listStyle: 'none'` on the `<ol>`, with the ordinal rendered as a
real element, the FIRST child of a flex `<li dir="auto">` — flexbox's row axis is
direction-aware by specification, so the number leads on the correct side and sits inside
the content box it can never escape. The wrapper around title/question/details carries no
`dir` of its own, deliberately: `dir="auto"` skips a descendant that has its own `dir`
when hunting for a first strong character, so giving the wrapper one would leave the
`<li>` with no resolution source at all. `direction.test.ts`'s list-marker check
(`disablesNativeMarker`/`isDirectionAwareContainer`, replacing `reservesRoomOnBothSides`)
now asserts the mechanism directly — no native marker, and the `<li>` is itself a
flex/grid container — rather than measuring a proxy for it; each half was confirmed to
fail on its own when reverted. `role="list"` on the `<ol>` pays back the one accessibility
cost of removing the marker: WebKit drops an `<ol>`'s list semantics from the
accessibility tree once `list-style: none` takes its marker away, which would have gone
unnoticed here — VoiceOver on the owner's own iPhone is exactly where it would have
surfaced.

The same finding also covered `ClassQuestions`' `Problem:`/`Last time:` lines, diagnosed at
the time as a wrap-alignment gap and fixed with `display: 'inline-block'` on the value's
own isolate. A seventh sealed finding (below) found that diagnosis incomplete — the value
having its own bidi order was never the same claim as the ROW having the right
alignment — and replaced it with a different fix entirely. See "Seventh rejection" above
for what actually shipped.

## Fifth rejection: the instrument-name check had to become positive, not just a ban (2026-09-12)

A fifth sealed review found the fourth rejection's fix was still a negative check —
banning `dir="ltr"`/`"rtl"` around an instrument name — which cannot detect a name with
NO direction treatment at all, an alias beyond the two literal anchors the check knew
(`instrumentName`, `{inst}`), or a name fused into a template string before anything
renders. Real, live instances of all three: Repertoire's `PathwayCard`, Session Plan's
two page titles, wide Lessons' sidebar heading and detail-pane header, Today's
cross-instrument "in progress"/"plan"/"routine" rows (built as pre-joined template
strings), Today's instrument switcher and `EmptyState` title and "Before your … class"
heading, and ActiveBlock's/CloseBlock's own eyebrow (mis-classifying the instrument's own
name as fixed English in their own comments). Fixed by replacing the ban with a positive,
mechanically-discovering check in `direction.test.ts`: `instrumentNameOccurrences` finds
every current renderer from the SHAPES this codebase uses to produce one (the helper call,
a property read, a local alias of either via destructure-rename/const-binding/find-and-name,
or a per-item `.name` read inside an `instruments` iteration) rather than a location list,
and `resolvesOwnDirection` asserts the invariant itself — the nearest ancestor `dir` must
be `"auto"` AND nothing else may render before the name within that ancestor's body, or
the ancestor's resolution belongs to whatever precedes it, not to the name riding along
beside it. Two sites deliberately stay bare because they are already the first strong
content of their own dir="auto" ancestor (Insights.tsx's `<th>`, Today.tsx's
cross-instrument `{inst.name}` row) — isolating either would break, not fix, them, the
same reasoning that earlier reverted isolating `stage.title`. Two gaps are named rather
than silently left: `QuickAdd.tsx`'s instrument-picker button has the identical bare-name
defect but sits in a file this lane's own contract puts out of scope, so the check
explicitly excludes it instead of failing on a bug this lane cannot fix; and
`src/domain/insights.ts` fuses an instrument name into a generated sentence one layer
below where a presentation-only lane can reach, left open for its own lane. See
AGENTS.md's "A FIFTH REJECTION..." section for the full account.

## Fourth rejection: an instrument name is user text, not generated copy (2026-09-12)

A sealed review found four sites (`ItemCard.tsx`, `ItemDetail.tsx`,
`PathwayDetail.tsx`, `Repertoire.tsx`) forcing an item's or work's instrument name under
`dir="ltr"` as if it were generated metadata like `ITEM_TYPE_LABELS` sitting next to
it — but an instrument is renameable in Settings, Farsi included, so it is the owner's
own editable text and needed its own `dir="auto"` isolate instead. Auditing every
remaining `LTR_ISOLATE_SITES` entry against its real source (not just the four named)
found a fifth of the identical shape (`Today.tsx`'s "routine running" row, bundling the
instrument name and a fixed English suffix into one `dir="ltr"` span) and two with no
direction treatment at all — invisible to that audit because it can only see spans that
already carry a `dir`: the Plan doorway's mismatched-instrument row (the exact twin of
the routine row) and the weekly Balance row's instrument name, bare inside a
`.truncate` title span whose row is a CSS grid (isolating the row itself, rather than
the name, would have reversed its three columns for a Farsi instrument). All seven now
carry their own `dir="auto"`, and `direction.test.ts` bans the SHAPE going forward — any
`dir="ltr"`/`"rtl"` isolate whose body references `instrumentName` (a call, a bare
identifier, or a property access like `b.instrumentName`) fails — rather than
re-closing whichever locations a reviewer happened to enumerate.

## Third rejection: an isolate must be inline, a marker needs room on both sides, and the scanner's own blind spot (2026-09-12)

A third sealed review of the direction lane found the SAME family — mixed-content
groups, alignment, list markers, completeness — still open in `ItemMaterial.tsx`,
`Materials.tsx`, `ItemCard.tsx`, `RoutineRunner.tsx`, `Lessons.tsx`, `Repertoire.tsx` and
`ClassQuestions.tsx`, closed as three root causes rather than as seven counterexamples.

1. **A block-level isolate resolves its own alignment, independently of the group.**
   `ItemMaterial.tsx`'s detail line carried `<div className="tiny faint" dir="ltr">…
   </div>` — the isolate fixed the sentence's own bidi ordering but, because
   `text-align: start` is a per-box computed value resolved against that box's OWN
   `direction`, gave the div's `text-align` a LEFT resolution regardless of the group's
   (possibly RTL) one — the detail split from a right-aligned Farsi title exactly as
   before, one level down. Fixed by moving every such isolate to an inline `<span>`
   nested inside a `dir`-less block (the shape already used everywhere else in the
   file), and closed for good with a mechanical rule in `direction.test.ts`: no
   `dir="ltr"`/`dir="rtl"` may sit on anything but `span`/`bdi`. One rejected review
   found one file doing this; a structural ban is what stops a second file doing it
   next lane.

2. **A native list marker follows its OWN list item's direction, not the list's.**
   `ClassQuestions.tsx`'s `<ol>` reserved gutter space with `paddingInlineStart` alone
   while each `<li>` resolves its own direction via `dir="auto"` — the browser positions
   the outside `::marker` on that li's OWN start edge, so a Farsi item's marker lands on
   the right, the side the list reserved no room for, and gets pressed against or past
   the content border. Fixed with symmetric `paddingInline`. `direction.test.ts` scans
   every `<ol>`/`<ul>` for this shape now, not just this one list.

3. **The scanner itself skipped every `{…}` expression as opaque, contributing zero
   words — hiding a run built ENTIRELY from expressions.** `Materials.tsx`'s
   `{MATERIAL_SOURCE_LABELS[...]} · {MATERIAL_STATUS_LABELS[...]} ·{' '} {itemCount(...)}
   item{...}` reads as zero literal words to a scanner counting only literal text, while
   rendering three always-English fragments in a row, unisolated, next to a title that
   could resolve RTL. `unexemptedPhrase` now counts an opaque, non-JSX-bearing
   expression as ONE token (its content stays invisible from source, but its
   unisolated PRESENCE next to other content is the shape being caught); an expression
   containing its own nested JSX stays fully opaque, since its children are already
   reachable by the outer whole-file scan. That one change, plus re-auditing every
   recorded group by hand, surfaced the five named sites and further, unnamed ones of
   the identical shape: `Repertoire.tsx`'s second, near-duplicate work-count span (the
   non-Persian branch mirrors the fixed one and had simply been missed), `ActiveBlock`'s
   own mode/focus chips, `Attachments`'/`ItemDetail`'s file kind/size line,
   `StartBlock`'s/`Today`'s item-type/status labels, `StageDetail`'s strand/status
   line, `PathwayDetail`'s "Current"/"Done"/item-count badges and piece-count fallback,
   `Today`'s "routine running" indicator and its cross-instrument Overview row (a fixed
   sentence embedding the next item's own possibly-Farsi title, isolated the way
   `StageDetail`'s undo banner already does), and `Insights`' generated observation
   sentences. Two sites needed `dir="auto"` rather than `dir="ltr"` — a value authored
   independently of its neighbour, not generated copy: `RoutineRunner`'s upcoming
   segment label and `PathwayDetail`'s pathway `source`. A stage's own `title` was
   tried the same way and REVERTED: `stage.title` is not authored independently of
   `stage.code` — it is the SAME stage's fuller name, rendered only when it differs
   from the code — and a prior lane already settled that the two should AGREE on
   whichever direction the group resolves rather than one overriding the other
   (`PathwayDetail`'s stage rows, 2026-09-11 entry below: "even where a group DOES
   resolve LTR from its code, that is the point"). Isolating `stage.title` in its own
   `dir="auto"` would have pulled it OUT of the button's own auto-detection (a nested
   `dir` attribute is skipped by the HTML algorithm), which can flip the group's OWN
   resolved direction whenever `stage.code` itself has no strong character — the
   opposite of "agree." It stays a bare `<span>`, exactly like `stage.code`. Two
   flagged sites were genuine exceptions, recorded visibly in a new
   `UNEXEMPTED_PHRASE_ALLOWLIST` rather than isolated: a numeric progress counter
   (`{sp.done}/{sp.total}` — digits carry no bidi risk) and a compound "Pathway — Stage"
   breadcrumb built from two fields (one continuous label, not a title split from a
   foreign caption).

4. **`elementBody`'s depth counter did not recognise React's Fragment shorthand as an
   opening tag, only as a closing one — silently truncating the body several checks
   scan.** `</>` starts with `/`, so it matched the ordinary CLOSING-tag branch and
   decremented depth; `<>` starts with neither `/` nor a letter, so it matched nothing
   and never incremented it. Every `<>…</>` pair inside a group's body therefore
   decremented depth once more than it was ever incremented — and this codebase's own
   established shape for a conditional detail (`{stage && (<><span>…</span>
   <Link>…</Link></>)}`, `ItemDetail.tsx`'s header) uses exactly that shorthand. On
   that header, depth hit zero several tags before the `</header>` actually closes,
   so `unexemptedPhrase` silently stopped scanning before ever reaching
   `<span className="tiny faint">difficulty {item.difficulty}/5</span>` — a real,
   unisolated generated-English phrase that had been sitting in the group the whole
   time, invisible to a scanner whose whole claim is "detectable, not enumerated."
   Fixed by giving `<>` the same weight as any other opening tag; the fix surfaced
   this one concrete violation across every file the suite scans (no others were
   hiding behind it), now fixed with the same `dir="ltr"`/`dir="auto"` split as its
   sibling `row-wrap` (`instrumentName`/`ITEM_TYPE_LABELS` generated, `stage.code`/
   the material label left bare since both can be Farsi themselves) and its
   importance/difficulty/saturated row. A structural bug in the TEST's own tag
   traversal is exactly the kind of gap a purely example-driven fix cannot close —
   only re-deriving the traversal from first principles (does this construct open or
   close a nesting level?) finds it.

**A restructure, not a pure direction-only edit, in `Repertoire.tsx`'s `WorkRow`.**
Its metadata line was `[form, composer, gusheh, instrumentName, lastPractised]
.filter(Boolean).join(' · ')` — a single STRING assembled from fields in two
different authorships (Persian identity fields, genuinely Farsi; instrument name and
the last-practised phrase, generated English). A joined string has no seam to hang a
`dir=` on partway through, so isolating it correctly required rebuilding the array as
JSX nodes (`<span dir="auto">`/`<span dir="ltr">` per fragment) joined with an
explicit separator, rather than adding an attribute to existing markup. This is more
than the "direction wiring only" the contract asks of a non-loop file, but there was
no lighter way to give each fragment its own bidi base — flagged here rather than
left for a reviewer to have to notice on their own.

**The scanner's own comment-stripping had a latent bug this work exposed, not
introduced.** `stripComments` treated any `'`/`"` as a real string delimiter and
scanned forward, unbounded, for its match. Plain JSX text containing an apostrophe
(`StageDetail.tsx`: "That stage doesn't exist.") is not a string at all; hitting that
apostrophe put the scanner into a phantom "inside a string" state that swallowed
everything after it — including real comments — until an unrelated quote later
happened to close it, cascading through the rest of the file. This had been silently
true all along and only surfaced because a new comment inside the corrupted span
happened to quote `dir="ltr"` in its own prose, which the (no longer stripped) comment
then exposed to the new block-isolate scan as a phantom real attribute. Fixed at the
root: a `'`/`"` now starts a real string only if its match appears before the next
newline (every real string/attribute value here is single-line); otherwise it passes
through as ordinary text. Backtick template literals keep their unbounded, multi-line
scan. This makes every check in the file more trustworthy, not just the new ones.

## The content leads: direction on the group, and a colour list that is bounded on purpose (2026-09-11)

**Direction lives on the GROUP, never on the title.** `dir="auto"` was on 47 title
elements and on no container anywhere, so a Farsi title resolved RTL and hugged the right
edge of its cell while its own English caption hugged the left. The fix is not a new
mechanism — it is moving the SAME native attribute up one level, to the element that
holds a title together with the details belonging to it. Two consequences are worth
recording because they are not obvious:

1. `dir="auto"` resolves from the FIRST STRONG CHARACTER in the subtree, so where an
   English eyebrow precedes the title in the DOM (Today's Practise-now card, the close
   screen's header, Session Plan's minutes/bucket line) the group is drawn around
   title + details and the eyebrow is deliberately left OUTSIDE it. Wrapping the whole
   card would pin the group LTR and change nothing.
2. Direction alone does not move text. Several groups sit under an ancestor pinning
   `text-align: left` (a picker row button, the practice screen's centred column), and
   `left` is inherited as a COMPUTED value — it does not re-resolve per element. Those
   groups set `text-align: start` on themselves.

The sweep is held closed by `src/components/direction.test.ts` rather than by care, and
its exception allowlist came out EMPTY: every title on every surface had a group it could
join. `PathwayDetail`'s stage rows were the candidate exception (an ascii-looking code
like "2A" leading a Farsi title) — but the Setar and Tar seeds author stage codes in
Farsi (`نشست`, `شور`, `ماهور`), so grouping code + title is both correct and what the
owner actually sees. Even where a group DOES resolve LTR from its code, that is the point:
the code and the title then agree instead of pointing at opposite edges.

**The colour list is bounded, and the planner's "six failing tokens" was an undercount.**
The plan measured each foreground token against `--bg` only. Two tokens fail there and
were missed (`--tone-progress` 4.41, `--tone-rest` 4.26), and more importantly `--bg` is
not where several of them RENDER: `--tone-rest` only ever appears as `.badge`/`.chip`
text over its own translucent `--tone-rest-soft` fill. `src/styles/contrast.test.ts`
therefore lists the pairs each token is ACTUALLY rendered on, compositing a translucent
fill over the card it sits in, and asserts them in all three palette blocks.

That honest list moves EIGHT light tokens (`--text-faint`, `--accent`, `--gold`,
`--tone-alert`, `--tone-warn`, `--tone-progress`, `--tone-good`, `--tone-rest`) and FOUR
dark ones (`--text-faint`, `--tone-alert`, `--tone-progress`, `--tone-rest`) rather than
the six + one the plan predicted. The list was NOT trimmed to make that arithmetic come
out right: an uncovered token is supposed to be a visible omission, and dropping badges
would have left two of the five tone tokens with no coverage at all. Three of the four
dark moves are 1–7 units and imperceptible. `--accent-contrast` (white on the primary
Start button, 3.95 at HEAD) needed no move of its own — darkening `--accent` to clear AA
against the page took that pair to 5.94. Every `-soft` fill, `--text`, `--text-dim` and
`--accent-dim` are untouched, because they pass.

**Both light blocks, every time.** `global.css` declares the light palette twice — at
`:root[data-theme='light']` and again inside `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light)
{ :root:not([data-theme]) }`. The duplicate is what an owner who never picked a theme
sees, so the test asserts both blocks AND that they agree token for token.

**Reading the stylesheet needed a workaround, not a config change.** `src` is typechecked
by `tsconfig.app.json`, which does not enable node types, and Vitest blanks every `.css`
module — `?raw` included — unless `test.css` is on in `vite.config.ts`. Both files are
outside this lane's scope. So the contrast test reads the real file through a dynamic
import whose specifier the compiler cannot resolve statically. Reading the REAL file is
the whole point: a table of colours copied into the test would keep passing while the app
shipped something else. The direction test needs no such trick — `import.meta.glob` with
`?raw` works for `.tsx`, and a glob also means a NEW page is swept in automatically.

**One ReviewPlan on the close screen.** The collapsed summary line and the expanded date
field are two renderings of ONE value, with a manual correction folded into it rather
than held beside it. The guarantee had to be structural: `CloseBlock` previously called
`planNextReview` twice (once for the preview hint, once inside `pickResult` to seed the
field), which is exactly the drift r-explainable-scheduling exists to prevent. A pure
formatter (`reviewSummaryLine`) renders the line and computes nothing, so a divergent
date is unrepresentable rather than merely remembered about.

**Today's order was built the other way round, tried, and REVERTED — by design.** The
lane built Practise now directly under the instrument switcher with Plan and Routines as
two compact peer doorways beneath it, on the argument that orchestrating a session is a
choice you make INSTEAD of taking the suggestion. It shipped as one ordering change with
no data or state implication precisely so the owner's own device could settle it. It did:
on 2026-09-11 the owner judged the original order better — Plan and Routines read as
belonging at the top of the page, and recommendation-first felt less natural — so the
order went back. That reversal is a PASSING outcome of the check, not a failure of the
lane, and everything else the lane built stands.

Worth recording for whoever reads the code next: BOTH orders keep the recommendation
above the fold at 390×844, so nothing about this ordering follows from the phone
constraint or from any other rule in AGENTS.md. It is a taste judgement that only the
owner can make, and the argument for recommendation-first is genuinely available to
re-derive — which is exactly why `Today.tsx` and AGENTS.md now say, in so many words,
not to act on it without asking.

**Rejection findings, addressed (fresh review, 2026-09-11).** A sealed fresh review of
this lane's diff returned `request_changes` against two families, fixed comprehensively
rather than by patching the two cited examples:

1. **Mixed-content groups and completeness.** Grouping a Farsi title with an
   ALWAYS-ENGLISH generated detail (`buildReason`, `planSegmentReason`) under one
   `dir="auto"` fixed the ALIGNMENT but broke the detail's own bidi ordering: the Farsi
   title's resolved RTL base became the detail's base too, and FriBidi renders a trailing
   neutral character (the sentence's own full stop) using that base when nothing more
   specific claims it — so it visually jumped to the start. Fixed by nesting a
   `dir="ltr"` isolate around each such detail (Today's Practise-now card and secondary
   recommendations, ItemDetail's "practise this part now", Session Plan's segment
   list and runner) — grouping and alignment are unchanged, only the isolate's own
   internal ordering is fixed. A structurally identical bug existed the other way round
   for FREE TEXT the owner typed after a fixed English label (ActiveBlock's
   `constraint`/`problem`, "last time you decided to try"): the label was the subtree's
   first strong text, so `dir="auto"` on the whole line resolved from the label and never
   saw the owner's own (possibly Farsi) words — fixed the same way the codebase already
   excludes an eyebrow, by giving the VALUE its own nested `dir="auto"` and leaving the
   label outside it. Today's Routines doorway had the same eyebrow-first bug at the
   button level ("Resume your routine"/"Routines" decided the direction, not the routine's
   own name) — fixed by moving `dir="auto"` off the button and onto a block wrapper
   around just the name, mirroring the shape `ElsewhereSessions` already used a few lines
   above it (an inline `<span>` there would silently break `.truncate`'s ellipsis, since
   `overflow`/`text-overflow` do nothing on a non-replaced inline box). ActiveBlock's
   header stayed CENTRED despite the contract requiring Farsi right / English left on that
   screen — the page's own `text-align: center` (correct for the timer ring and buttons)
   was never overridden for the title group; it now sets `text-align: start` on itself,
   which is a deliberate LAYOUT CHANGE for English on that one screen and is documented in
   AGENTS.md as not conflicting with "English keeps its layout" elsewhere (that non-goal
   guards against a Farsi-style right-align, not against ac-6's explicit left-for-English
   requirement on Active).

   The COMPLETENESS gap: `direction.test.ts`'s "every surface has a group" check passed
   as long as ONE group survived anywhere in the file, so deleting the Practise-now card's
   own `dir="auto"` still passed because Today.tsx has several unrelated groups. Fixed
   with `GROUP_SITE_INVENTORY` — every group-level site recorded in order, duplicates
   included, asserted with `toEqual` against the live scan, so removing any ONE recorded
   site anywhere fails regardless of what else survives in the same file. Building that
   inventory surfaced a second, unrelated defect in the scanner itself: this file's own
   prose repeatedly writes the literal string `dir="auto"` in comments, and the naive
   regex scan matched those too — usually producing a site with no real enclosing tag, but
   at least once walking backward out of a long comment and mis-attributing an unrelated
   component tag from elsewhere in the file as if it were the match's real element. The
   scanner now strips `//` and `/* */` comments (copying string/template literals through
   verbatim, since that is where a REAL `dir="auto"` attribute value lives) before
   matching.

2. **CloseBlock manual-date preservation.** `pickResult` cleared the manual `override` on
   every result change — correct when the engine actually re-plans (a fresh judgement
   deserves a fresh plan, not a stale correction pinned to the old one), wrong when it
   doesn't: a manual-mode item (`item.reviewMode === 'manual'`) has no automatic plan for
   ANY result, so a date the owner had just typed in was never tied to a particular
   judgement, and clearing it turned a deliberate "come back on this date" into an
   accidental decline the moment they picked a different result. Fixed by gating the
   clear on `reviewOverrideSurvivesResultChange(item.reviewMode)`
   (`src/components/format.ts`) rather than calling `planNextReview` a second time inside
   `pickResult` — CloseBlock's single `ReviewPlan` derivation is unchanged; this is a
   boolean read of the item's own mode, not a second value that could disagree with it.
   The predicate is tested against the real engine across all six results for both a
   manual- and an auto-mode item, not asserted in prose alone.

**Second rejection, closed as a family rather than as four counterexamples
(2026-09-11).** A second sealed review found the FIRST fix's isolate pattern had not
been applied everywhere it was needed: `CloseBlock`'s own "A few seconds to capture
what happened." sat bare in the item-title group (the identical defect the first
rejection fixed elsewhere in the same file's neighbours), and `ClassQuestions`'
question/problem/last-observation carried no isolate of any kind, unlike the
`ActiveBlock` shape the first fix established. Rather than patching just those two
call sites, the whole surface list was re-audited for the same two shapes:

- **Fixed English copy/metadata bare in a group** — beyond the two named sites, the
  same "N segments · M min" phrase existed identically in THREE places
  (`Today.tsx`'s `TodayRoutineRow`, `PathwayDetail.tsx`'s `RoutineRow`,
  `StageDetail.tsx`'s `RoutineCard` — one component per surface a routine can be
  started from, never refactored into one shared component), `StaleNote`'s "Running
  far past its target…" (rendered inside two different title groups), Today's due-review
  caption ("due `relativeDay(...)`"), the NAS-reference warning sentences
  (`Lessons.tsx`, `ItemMaterial.tsx`), `ItemDetail.tsx`'s "Study source:" label and
  `StageDetail.tsx`'s "Added "…" — not practised yet." undo banner. Every one now
  carries the same nested `dir="ltr"` isolate as the first fix's `reason` spans.
- **Independently-authored values bare in a group** — `PathwayDetail.tsx`'s
  `pathway.description`/`pathway.note`, editable independently of the pathway's own
  name, needed the same `dir="auto"` isolate `ActiveBlock`'s `constraint`/`problem`
  already carry.

**The test itself was the real gap, not just the four sites.** `direction.test.ts`
proved a GROUP carries direction; it never proved a CHILD inside it does. A generic
"no bare Latin text in a group" rule would have forced changes to the already-correct
`ActiveBlock` label shape (`Constraint: ` stays bare on purpose, immediately followed
by its own isolate), so the new check (`unexemptedPhrase`) walks a group's body in
source order, judges an accumulated run of exposed text at each TAG boundary (never at
an expression boundary, or `{n} segments · {m} min` fragments into single innocent
words), and exempts a run — regardless of its length — the moment it is immediately
followed by an element carrying its own `dir=`. Two recorded ledgers
(`ISOLATED_VALUE_SITES`, `LTR_ISOLATE_SITES`) cover what no source scan can prove:
an expression's own content (`{q.currentProblem}`) is opaque from source, and a
component like `StaleNote` renders its isolate from its OWN definition, invisible from
any of its call sites. Both carry the same visibility contract as
`GROUP_SITE_INVENTORY` — a new site must be added, visibly, never inferred silently.

## Serving NAS class recordings over HTTPS (Task 3, 2026-07; CORRECTED 2026-09-10)

**Problem.** The app runs on an HTTPS origin (GitHub Pages). Class videos and scores
live on the Synology NAS under `homes/ethan/SNDK/video-courses` (on disk:
`/volume1/homes/ethan/SNDK/video-courses`). A lesson reference stores a *relative*
path (e.g. `setar-classes/session-1-…/video.mp4`); the app joins it under a **NAS
base URL** set in Settings. Two things must be true for playback:

1. The base URL must be a real `https://` origin. (A scheme-less value like
   `ds220plus.taild1d1f7.ts.net` was previously concatenated raw and treated as a
   *relative* URL against the Pages origin — so every recording opened the same
   in-app 404. Fixed in `normalizeBaseUrl` / `resolveRecording`,
   `src/domain/recordings.ts`.)
2. The folder must be served over HTTPS. DSM on `:5000` does **not** serve raw
   files, and plain `http://` links are mixed content that iOS blocks.

**What is ACTUALLY running (probed 2026-09-10, and this corrects what this record
used to claim).** This file previously recorded *Tailscale Serve on the Synology* as
the chosen mechanism, with a runbook. That is **not** what is in place, and an agent
following that runbook would have configured the wrong thing:

- There is **no Tailscale CLI and no Tailscale.app on this Mac**.
- `https://192.168.0.20:5010/` answers **HTTP 200 from nginx** and already serves
  **real browsable directory listings** (mod_autoindex-style "Index of /"), whose
  document root IS the `video-courses` folder — it lists `setar-classes/`,
  `tar-classes/` and `classical-guitar/`, and `/setar-classes/` answers 200. So the
  existing relative references already resolve against it, and a **Browse** link
  needs no server change whatsoever; the capability was already there and unused.
- The certificate is Synology's own default (`CN=synology`, issuer
  `Synology Inc. CA`) and does **not** match `192.168.0.20`. That is why this works
  on the MacBook, where the exception has been accepted, and why **each new device
  must accept the certificate once** before NAS links open there. A certificate
  prompt on the iPhone is INFRASTRUCTURE, not an app defect.

**Current base URL:** `https://192.168.0.20:5010` (LAN only).

**The app is deliberately TRANSPORT-AGNOSTIC, and that is now enforced rather than
hoped for.** A reference pasted from the NAS listing is stored **relative** to the
configured base (`relativizeReference`, `recordings.ts`, tested) instead of as the
absolute URL the browser gave you. An absolute URL would pin that reference to one
route to the NAS — dead on a phone away from home, and dead everywhere the day the
base URL changes. Because only the path is stored, **choosing the transport is a
decision that can be changed later without rewriting a single stored reference.**

**That choice is deliberately left OPEN.** Staying on the LAN address, moving to
Tailscale (`ts.net` gives a valid certificate and tailnet-only access; Go's file
server supports Range requests, so video seeking works), or putting a reverse proxy
in front are all still available. Whichever is chosen, only the Settings base URL
changes.

**Rejected alternatives.** WebDAV (auth prompts break iOS inline video); per-file
File Station share links (unmaintainable — one link per file). Also deliberately NOT
built: a `scan:nas` index feeding an in-app file picker — the NAS already renders
browsable listings, so browse → copy → paste closes most of the gap without adding a
build script, a generated reference module, a staleness story and a Mac-only
dependency. Revisit only if browsing and pasting proves insufficient in real use.

**Never modify the recordings themselves** — the app only stores references, and
removing a reference never touches the NAS file.

## Session Plan — algorithm & evidence (2026-07-18)

The Session Plan (`src/domain/plan.ts`) lays out a time-budgeted session as ordered
segments in five buckets (warm-up · lesson · review · deep · cool-down). It reuses the
recommendation engine's `scoreItems` — no second ranking — and is pure and deterministic.

**Decisions.**
- **Minutes always sum to the budget.** A largest-remainder split by bucket weight, each
  segment ≥ 2 min; when the budget can't seat every segment, the lowest-priority ones are
  dropped before allocation. This is the one load-bearing invariant and is tested across
  15/20/30/45/60 and the edge cases.
- **The plan runs REAL blocks, not a countdown.** The runner drives the existing
  start→active→close flow; `closeSession` advances the plan only when the closed block was
  the current segment. `RoutineRunner` (the warm-up timer) is deliberately left untouched.
- **The running plan is ephemeral** (store-only, never in `PracticeDB`) so it never syncs
  or lands in a backup as data.
- **Shares are sane defaults, adjustable, never "optimal".** Bucket minute shares come from
  `SchedulingParams` (Settings) — the app makes no claim of an ideal ratio.

**Evidence (used as rationale for the SHAPE, not as precise prescriptions).**
- Spacing effect → short, spaced segments + SM-2 (Cepeda et al. 2006; Simmons 2012).
- Contextual interference / interleaving → the no-adjacent-same-item mix and the "it feels
  harder; that's the point" framing (Shea & Morgan 1979; Carter & Grahn 2016; Stambaugh 2011).
- Retrieval practice → short review slots (Roediger & Karpicke 2006).
- Deliberate, goal-directed practice → one focus per segment (Ericsson et al. 1993;
  Duke, Simmons & Cash 2009).
- Sleep consolidation → cool-down / end-on-stability (Simmons & Duke 2006).

No claim of an optimal minute ratio is made; the shares are defaults the user can adjust.
